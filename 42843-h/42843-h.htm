<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>In this work, an attempt has been made to connect together a series of
original documents, by a narrative of events in the life of him to whom
they relate; an account of his literary labours; and a picture of his
character, according to the representations of it preserved by his
contemporaries. The scantiness of the resources at the command of
previous biographers, and the extent and variety of the new materials
now presented to the world, render unnecessary any other apology for the
present publication. How far these materials have been rightly used,
readers and critics must judge; but I may be perhaps excused for
offering a brief explanation of the spirit in which I desired to
undertake the task; and the responsibility I felt attached to the duty,
of ushering before the public, documents of so much importance to
literature.</p>

<p>The critic or biographer, who writes from materials already before the
public, may be excused if he give way to his prepossessions and
partialities, and limit his task to the representation of all that
justifies and supports them. If he have any misgivings, that, in
following the direction of his prepossessions, he may not have taken the
straight line of truth, he may be assured, that if the cause be one of
any interest, an <!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_viii" id="Page_v1_viii">[viii]</a></span>advocate, having the same resources at his command,
will speedily appear on the other side. But when original manuscripts
are for the first time to be used, it is due to truth, and to the desire
of mankind to satisfy themselves about the real characters of great men,
that they should be so presented as to afford the means of impartially
estimating those to whom they relate. We possess many brilliant
Eulogiums of the leaders of our race&mdash;many vivid pictures of their
virtues and their vices&mdash;their greatness or their weakness. But if a
humbler, it is perhaps a no less useful task, to represent these
men&mdash;their character, their conduct, and the circumstances of their
life, precisely as they were; rejecting nothing that truly exemplifies
them, because it is beneath the dignity of biography, or at variance
with received notions of their character and the tendency of their
public conduct. The desire to have a closer view of the fountain head
whence the outward manifestations of a great intellect have sprung, is
but one of the many examples of man's spirit of inquiry from effects to
their causes; and the desire will not be gratified by reproducing the
object of inquiry in all the pomp and state of his public intercourse
with the world, and keeping the veil still closed upon his inner nature.
It is difficult to write with mere descriptive impartiality, and without
exhibiting any bias of opinion, on matters which are, at the same time,
the most deeply interesting to mankind, and the objects of their
strongest partialities. Though the task that was before me was simply to
describe, <!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_ix" id="Page_v1_ix">[ix]</a></span>and never to controvert, I do not profess to have avoided all
indications of opinion in the departments of the work which have the
character of original authorship. I have the satisfaction, however, of
reflecting, that the documents, which are the real elements of value in
this work, are impartially presented to the reader, and that nothing is
omitted which seemed to bear distinctly on the character and conduct of
David Hume.</p>

<p>I now offer a few words in explanation of the nature of these original
documents. The late Baron Hume had collected together his uncle's
papers, consisting of the letters addressed to him, the few drafts or
copies he had left of letters written by himself, the letters addressed
<em>by</em> him to his immediate relations, and apparently all the papers in
his handwriting, which had been left in the possession of the members of
his family. To these the Baron seems to have been enabled to add the
originals of many of the letters addressed by him to his intimate
friends, Adam Smith, Blair, Mure, and others. The design with which this
interesting collection was made, appears to have been that of preparing
a work of a similar description to the present; and it is a misfortune
to literature that this design was not accomplished. On the death of
Baron Hume, it was found that he had left this mass of papers at the
uncontrolled disposal of the Council of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
This learned body, after having fully considered the course proper to be
adopted in these circumstances, determined that they would permit the
papers to be made use of by any person <!-- Page x --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_x" id="Page_v1_x">[x]</a></span>desirous to apply them to a
legitimate literary purpose, who might enjoy their confidence. Having
for some time indulged in a project of writing a life of Hume, postponed
from time to time, on account of the imperfect character of the
materials at my disposal, I applied to the Council of the Royal Society
for access to the Hume papers; and after having considered my
application with that deliberation which their duty to the public as
custodiers of these documents seemed to require, they acceded to my
request. The ordinary form of returning thanks for the privilege of
using papers in the possession of private parties, appears not to be
applicable to this occasion; and I look on the concession of the Council
as conferring on me an honour, which is felt to be all the greater, that
it was bestowed in the conscientious discharge of a public duty.</p>

<p>The Hume papers, besides a manuscript of the "Dialogues on Natural
Religion," and of a portion of the History, fill seven quarto volumes of
various thickness, and two thin folios. In having so large a mass of
private and confidential correspondence committed to their charge, the
Council naturally felt that they would be neglecting their duty, if they
did not keep in view the possibility that there might be in the
collection, allusions to the domestic conduct or private affairs of
persons whose relations are still living; and that good taste, and a
kind consideration for private feelings should prevent the accidental
publication of such passages. On inspection, less of this description of
matter was found than so large a mass of private <!-- Page xi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_xi" id="Page_v1_xi">[xi]</a></span>documents might be
supposed to contain. There is no passage which I have felt any
inclination to print, as being likely to afford interest to the reader,
of which the use has been denied me; and I can therefore say that I have
had in all respects full and unlimited access to this valuable
collection. Before leaving this matter, I take the opportunity of
returning my thanks for the kind and polite attention I have received
from those gentlemen of the Council, on whom the arrangements for my
getting access to these papers, imposed no little labour and sacrifice
of valuable time.</p>

<p>A rumour has obtained currency regarding the contents of these papers,
which seems to demand notice on the present occasion.</p>

<p>It is stated in <cite>The Quarterly Review</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_XI:1_1" id="FNanchor_XI:1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI:1_1" class="fnanchor">[xi:1]</a> that "those who have
examined the Hume papers&mdash;which we know only by report&mdash;speak highly of
their interest, but add, that they furnish painful disclosures
concerning the opinions then prevailing amongst the clergy of the
northern metropolis: distinguished ministers of the gospel encouraging
the scoffs of their familiar friend, the author of 'the Essay upon
Miracles;' and echoing the blasphemies of their associate, the author of
the 'Essay upon Suicide!'" I have the pleasing task of removing the
painful feelings which, as this writer justly observes, must attend the
belief in such a rumour, by saying that I could not find it <!-- Page xii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_xii" id="Page_v1_xii">[xii]</a></span>justified
by a single sentence in the letters of the Scottish clergy contained in
these papers, or in any other documents that have passed under my eye. I
make this statement as an act of simple justice to the memory of men to
whose character, being a member of a different church, I have no
partisan attachment: and I may add that, in the whole course of my
pretty extensive researches in connexion with Hume and his friends, I
found no reason for believing that letters containing evidence of any
such frightful duplicity ever existed.</p>

<p>Among these papers, a variety of letters, chiefly from eminent
foreigners, though interesting in themselves, were entitled to no place
in the body of this work, as illustrative of the life and character of
Hume. These I had intended to print in an appendix, believing that,
though not directly connected with my own project, the lovers of
literature would not readily excuse me for neglecting the opportunity
afforded by my access to these papers, for adding to the stock of the
letters of celebrated men. But the work, according to its original scope
and design, continuing to increase under my hands, I found that if it
contained the documents specially referred to in the text, its bulk
would be sufficiently extended, and I have determined to let the other
papers here alluded to follow in a separate volume, which will contain
letters to Hume from D'Alembert, Turgot, Diderot, Helvétius, Franklin,
Walpole, and other distinguished persons.</p>

<p>The reader will find that many original documents <!-- Page xiii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_xiii" id="Page_v1_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>printed in this
collection have been obtained from other sources than the Hume papers.
My acknowledgments are particularly due to the Earl of Minto, for the
liberality with which he allowed me the uncontrolled use of the large
and valuable collection of correspondence between Hume and Sir Gilbert
Elliot. For the letters in the Kilravock collection I am indebted to
Cosmo Innes, Esq., sheriff of Morayshire; and I obtained access to those
addressed to Colonel Edmondstoune, through the polite intervention of
George Dundas, Esq., sheriff of Selkirkshire. I am obliged to the
kindness of Lord Murray for much assistance in obtaining materials and
information for this work; and to Robert Chambers, Esq., who has been
accustomed from time to time, to preserve such letters and other
documents connected with Scottish biography, as came under his notice, I
have to offer my thanks for the whole of his collections regarding Hume,
which he generously transferred to me.</p>

<p>In the use of printed books, where the Advocates' Library, to which I
have professional access, has failed me, I have found the facilities for
consulting the select and well arranged collection of the Writers to the
Signet of great service.</p>

<p>I owe acknowledgments to many friends for useful advice in the conduct
of the work. To one especially, who, after having long occupied a
distinguished place in the literature of his country, permits his
friends still to enjoy the social exercise of those intellectual
qualities that have delighted the world, I am indebted for such critical
counsel as no other could have given, <!-- Page xiv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_xiv" id="Page_v1_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>and few would have had the
considerate kindness to bestow, were they able.</p>

<p>Of the two portraits engraved for this work, that which will, probably,
most strikingly attract attention, is taken from a bust, of coarse and
unartistic workmanship, but bearing all the marks of a genuine likeness.
It was moulded by a country artist, at the desire of Hume's esteemed
friend, Professor Ferguson; and I am under obligations to his son, Sir
Adam, for the privilege of using it on this occasion, and to Sir George
Mackenzie, for having kindly mentioned its existence, and exerted
himself in its recovery, after it had been long lost sight of. The
medallion, from which the other portrait is taken, is in the possession
of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esq., by whom I was presented with the
engraved plate, from which the fac simile of a letter, addressed by Hume
to his collateral ancestor, is printed.</p>

all letters from him with which the public is already
familiar, in the smaller type, in order that the reader coming
to a document with which he is already acquainted, might see

<p class="section">David Hume was born at Edinburgh, on the 26th of April,<a name="FNanchor_1:1_2" id="FNanchor_1:1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:1_2" class="fnanchor">[1:1]</a> 1711. He
was the second son of Joseph Hume, or Home, proprietor of the estate of
Ninewells, in the parish of Chirnside, in Berwickshire. His mother was a
daughter of Sir David Falconer of Newton, who filled the office of Lord
President of the Court of Session from 1682 to 1685, and is known to
lawyers as the collector of a series of decisions of the Court of
Session, published in 1701. His son, the brother of Hume's mother,
succeeded to the barony of Halkerton in 1727. Mr. Hume the elder, was a
member of the Faculty of Advocates.<a name="FNanchor_1:2_3" id="FNanchor_1:2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1:2_3" class="fnanchor">[1:2]</a> He appears, <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_2" id="Page_v1_2">[2]</a></span>however, if he
ever intended to follow the legal profession as a means of livelihood,
to have early given up that view, and to have lived, as his eldest son
John afterwards did, the life of a retired country gentleman.</p>

<p>It is an established rule, that all biographical attempts of
considerable length, shall contain some genealogical inquiry regarding
the family of their subject. The present writer is relieved both of the
labour of such an investigation, and the responsibility of adjusting it
to the appropriate bounds, by being able to print a letter in which the
philosopher has himself exhibited the results of an inquiry into the
subject.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">David Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Alexander Home</span> <i>of Whitfield</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 12th April, 1758.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was told by Mrs. Home, when she was in town,
that you intended to make some researches into our family, in
order to give them to Mr. Douglas, who must insert them, or
the substance of them, into his account of the Scottish
nobility.<a name="FNanchor_2:1_4" id="FNanchor_2:1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:1_4" class="fnanchor">[2:1]</a> I think that your purpose is very laudable, and
is very obliging to us all; and for this reason I shall inform
you of what I know of the matter. These hints will at least
serve to point out to you more authentic documents.</p>

<p>"My brother has no very ancient charters: the oldest he has,
are some charters of the lands of Horndean. There he is
designated Home, or Hume, of Ninewells. <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_3" id="Page_v1_3">[3]</a></span>The oldest charters
of Ninewells are lost. It was always a tradition in our
family, that we were descended from Lord Home, in this manner.
Lord Home gave to his younger son the lands of Tinningham,
East Lothian. This gentleman proved a spendthrift and
dissipated his estate, upon which Lord Home provided his
grandchild, or nephew, in the lands of Ninewells as a
patrimony. This, probably, is the reason why, in all the books
of heraldry, we are styled to be cadets of Tinningham; and
Tinningham was undoubtedly a cadet of Home. I was told by my
grand-aunt, Mrs. Sinclair of Hermiston, that Charles earl of
Home told her, that he had been looking over some old papers
of the family, where the Lord Home designs Home of Ninewells
either his grandson or nephew, I do not precisely remember
which.</p>

<p>"The late Sir James Home of Blackadder showed me a paper,
which he himself had copied a few days before from a
gravestone in the churchyard of Hutton: the words were
these&mdash;'Here lies John Home of Bell, son of John Home of
Ninewells, son of John Home of Tinningham, son of John Lord
Home, founder of Dunglas.'</p>

<p>"I find that this Lord Home, founder of Dunglas, was the very
person whom Godscroft says went over to France with the
Douglas, and was father to Tinningham: so thus the two stories
tally exactly. He was killed either in the battle of Crevant
or Verneuil, gained by the Duke of Bedford, the regent,
against the French. Douglas fell in the same battle. I think
it was the battle of Verneuil. All the French and English
histories, as well as the Scotch, contain this fact. This Lord
Home was your ancestor, and ours, lived in the time of James
the First and Second of Scotland, Henrys the Fifth and Sixth
of England.</p>

<p><!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_4" id="Page_v1_4">[4]</a></span>"I have asked old Bell the descent of his family. He said he
was really sprung from Ninewells, but that the lands fell to
an heiress who married a brother of Polwarth's.</p>

<p>"By Godscroft's account, Tinningham was the third son of Home
in the same generation that Wedderburn was the second, so that
the difference of antiquity is nothing, or very
inconsiderable.</p>

<p>"The readiest way of vouching these facts would be for you to
take a jaunt to the churchyard of Hutton, and inquire for
Bell's monument, and see whether the inscription be not
obliterated; for it is above twenty-five years ago that I saw
the paper in Sir James Home's hand, and he told us, at that
time, that the inscription was somewhat difficult to be read.
If it be still legible it would be very well done to take a
copy of it in some authentic manner, and transmit it to Mr.
Douglas, to be inserted in his volume. If it be utterly
effaced, the next, but most difficult task would be to search
for the paper above-mentioned in the family of Home: it must
be some time about the year 1440 or 1450. If both these means
fail, we must rest upon the tradition.</p>

<p>"I am not of the opinion of some, that these matters are
altogether to be slighted. Though we should pretend to be
wiser than our ancestors, yet it is arrogant to pretend that
we are wiser than the other nations of Europe, who, all of
them, except perhaps the English, make great account of their
family descent. I doubt that our morals have not much improved
since we began to think riches the sole thing worth
regarding.<a name="FNanchor_4:1_5" id="FNanchor_4:1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:1_5" class="fnanchor">[4:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_5" id="Page_v1_5">[5]</a></span>"If I were in the country I should be glad to attend you to
Hutton, in order to make the inquiry I propose. I doubt
whether my brother will think of doing it: he has such an
extreme aversion to every thing that savours of vanity, that
he would not willingly expose himself to censure; but this is
a justice that one owes to their posterity, for we are not
certain that these matters will be always so little regarded.</p>

<p>"I shall farther observe to you, that the Lord Home, founder
of Dunglas, married the heiress of that family, of the name of
Pepdie, and from her we always bear the Pepingos in our arms.</p>

<p>"I find in Hall's Chronicle that the Earl of Surrey, in an
inroad upon the Merse, made during the reign of Henry the
Eighth, after the battle of Flouden, destroyed the castles of
Hedderburn, West Nisgate, and Blackadder, and the towers of
East Nisgate, and Winwalls. The names, you see, are somewhat
disfigured; but I cannot doubt but he means Nisbet and
Ninewells: the situation of the places leads us to that
conjecture.</p>

<p><!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_6" id="Page_v1_6">[6]</a></span>"I have reason to believe, notwithstanding the fact, as
Ninewells lay very near Berwick, our ancestors commonly paid
contributions to the governor of that place, and abstained
from hostilities and were prevented from ravages. There is, in
Hayne's State Papers, a very particular account of the ravages
committed by an inroad of the English, during the minority of
Queen Mary.<a name="FNanchor_6:1_6" id="FNanchor_6:1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:1_6" class="fnanchor">[6:1]</a> Not a village, scarce a single house in the
Merse, but what is mentioned as burnt or overthrown, till you
come to Whitwater. East of the river, there was not one
destroyed. This reason will perhaps explain why, in none of
the histories of that time, even the more particular, there is
any mention made of our ancestors; while we meet with
Wedderburn, Aiton, Manderston, Cowdenknows, Sprot, and other
cadets of Home.</p>

<p>"I have learned from my mother, that my father, in a lawsuit
with Hilton, claimed an old apprizing upon the lands of
Hutton-Hall, upon which there had been no deed done for 140
years. Hilton thought that it must necessarily be expired; but
my father was able to prove that, during that whole time there
had not been forty years of majority in the family. He died
soon after, and left my mother very young; so that there was
near 160 years during which there was not forty years of
majority.<a name="FNanchor_6:2_7" id="FNanchor_6:2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:2_7" class="fnanchor">[6:2]</a> Now we are upon this <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_7" id="Page_v1_7">[7]</a></span>subject, I shall just
mention to you a trifle, with regard to the spelling of our
name. The practice of spelling Hume is by far the most ancient
and most general till about the Restoration, when it became
common to spell Home contrary to the pronunciation. Our name
is frequently mentioned in Rymer's Fœdera, and always spelt
Hume. I find a subscription of Lord Hume in the memoirs of the
Sidney family, where it is spelt as I do at present. These are
a few of the numberless authorities on this head.</p>

<p>"I wish the materials I give you were more numerous and more
satisfactory; but such as they are, I am glad to have
communicated them to you.&mdash;I am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_7:1_8" id="FNanchor_7:1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7:1_8" class="fnanchor">[7:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p><!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_8" id="Page_v1_8">[8]</a></span>A competent authority in such matters gives the following partly
heraldic, partly topographical account of the Humes and their
territory:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hume of Ninewells, the family of the great historian, bore 'Vert a lion
rampant, argent, within a bordure or, charged with <em>nine wells</em>, or
springs, barry-wavy and argent.'</p>

<p>"The estate of Ninewells is so named from a cluster of springs of that
number. Their situation is picturesque. They burst forth from a gentle
declivity in front of the mansion, which has on each side a semicircular
rising bank, covered with fine timber, and fall, after a short time,
into the bed of the river Whitewater, which forms a boundary in the
front. These springs, as descriptive of their property, were assigned to
the Humes of this place, as a difference in arms from the chief of their
house."<a name="FNanchor_8:1_9" id="FNanchor_8:1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8:1_9" class="fnanchor">[8:1]</a></p>

<p>The scenes amidst which Hume passed his boyhood, and many of the years
of his later life, have subsequently, in the light of a national
literature, become a classic land, visited by strangers, with the same
feeling with which Hume himself trod the soil of Mantua. In his own
days, the elements of this literature were no less in existence; but it
was not part of his mental character to find any pleasing associations
in spots, remarkable only for the warlike or adventurous achievements
they had witnessed. Intellect was the material on which his genius
worked: with it were all his associations and sympathies; and what had
not been adorned by the feats of the mind had no charm in his eye. Had
he been a stranger of another land, visiting at the present, or some
later day, the scenes of the Lay and of Marmion, they would, without
doubt, <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_9" id="Page_v1_9">[9]</a></span>like the land of Virgil, have lit in his mind some sympathetic
glow; but the scenes illustrated solely by deeds of barbarous warfare,
and by a rude illiterate minstrelsy, had nothing in them to rouse a
mind, which was yet far from being destitute of its own peculiar
enthusiasm. He had often, in his history, to mention great historical
events that had taken place in the immediate vicinity of his paternal
residence, and in places to which he could hardly have escaped, if he
did not court occasional visits. About six miles from Ninewells, stands
Norham castle. Three or four miles farther off, are Twisel bridge, where
Surrey crossed the Till to engage the Scots, and the other localities
connected with the battle of Flodden. In the same neighbourhood is
Holiwell Haugh, where Edward I. met the Scottish nobility, when he
professed himself to be the arbiter of the disputes between Bruce and
Baliol. In his notices of these spots, in connexion with the historical
events which he describes, he betrays no symptom of having passed many
of his youthful days in their vicinity, but is as cold and general as
when he describes Agincourt or Marston Moor; and it may safely be said,
that in none of his historical or philosophical writings does any
expression used by him, unless in those cases where a Scoticism has
escaped his vigilance, betray either the district or the country of his
origin.<a name="FNanchor_9:1_10" id="FNanchor_9:1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:1_10" class="fnanchor">[9:1]</a> <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_10" id="Page_v1_10">[10]</a></span>Hume tells us, in his short autobiography, "My family was
not rich, and being myself a younger brother, my patrimony, according to
the mode of my country, was of course very slender. My father, who
passed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant, leaving me, with
an elder brother and a sister, under the care of our mother, a woman of
singular merit, who, though young and handsome, devoted herself entirely
to the rearing and education of her children." He says no more of his
education, than that he "passed through the ordinary course of education
with success." In a document which will be immediately quoted at length,
we find him speaking of having received the usual college education of
Scotland, which terminates when the student is fourteen or fifteen years
old. It is probable that he studied at the University of Edinburgh, in
the matriculation book of which the name of <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_11" id="Page_v1_11">[11]</a></span>"David Home" appears, as
intrant of the class of William Scott, Professor of Greek, on 27th
February, 1723. Holding the year to commence on 1st January, which was
then the practice in Scotland, though not in England, he would be at
that time nearly twelve years old. The name does not appear in any
of the subsequent matriculation lists: it was probably not then the
practice for the student to be entered more than once, at the
commencement of his curriculum; and neither the name of Hume, nor of
Home, occurs in the list of graduates.</p>

<p>Of his method of studying, and of his habits of life, after he left the
university, as of his literary aspirations and projects, we fortunately
possess some curious notices in his correspondence. The earliest letter
written by Hume, known to be extant, is in a scroll which has been
apparently preserved by himself. It is addressed to Michael Ramsay, with
whom it will be seen, from the letters quoted in the course of this
work, that the friendship formed, when both were young, remained
uninterrupted and vigorous during their mature years. I have been unable
to discover any thing of the history of this Michael Ramsay, beyond what
may be gathered from the internal evidence supplied by the
correspondence. He must have been destined for the English Church, but
he appears not to have taken orders; as in a letter from Hume, which,
though undated, must have been written at an advanced period of both
their lives, he is addressed "Michael Ramsay, Esq." Writing on 5th June,
1764, he says to Hume, "I continue in the old wandering way in which I
have passed so much of my life, and in which it is likely I shall end
it." He appears to have had many connexions well to do in the world, and
to have died before the year 1779, <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_12" id="Page_v1_12">[12]</a></span>leaving his papers in the possession
of a nephew having his own Christian name of Michael; which was also, it
may be observed, the name of the Chevalier Ramsay, of whom Hume's
correspondent was perhaps a relation.<a name="FNanchor_12:1_11" id="FNanchor_12:1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_12:1_11" class="fnanchor">[12:1]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"July 4, 1727.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">D<sup>r</sup> M.</span>&mdash;I received all the books you writ of, and your Milton
among the rest. When I saw it, I <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_13" id="Page_v1_13">[13]</a></span>perceived there was a
difference betwixt preaching and practising: you accuse me of
niceness, and yet practise it most egregiously yourself. What
was the necessity of sending your Milton, which I knew you
were so fond of? Why, I lent your's and can't get it. But
would you not, in the same manner, have lent your own? Yes.
Then, why this ceremony and good breeding? I write all this to
show you how easily any action may be brought to bear the
countenance of a fault. You may justify yourself very well, by
saying it was kindness; and I am satisfied with it, and thank
you for it. So, in the same manner, I may justify myself from
your reproofs. You say that I would not send in my papers,
because they were not polished nor brought to any form: which
you say is nicety. But was it not reasonable? Would you have
me send in my loose incorrect thoughts? Were such worth the
transcribing? All the progress that I made is but drawing the
outlines, on loose bits of paper: here a hint of a passion;
there a phenomenon in the mind accounted for: in another the
alteration of these accounts; sometimes a remark upon an
author I have been reading; and none of them worth to any
body, and I believe scarce to myself. The only design I had of
mentioning any of them at all, was to see what you would have
said of your own, whether they were of the same kind, and if
you would send any; and I have got my end, for you have given
a most satisfactory reason for not communicating them, by
promising they shall be told <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</i>&mdash;a much better way
indeed, and in which I promise myself much satisfaction; for
the free conversation of a friend is what I would prefer to
any entertainment. Just now I am entirely confined to myself
and library for diversion since we parted.</p>

<p>And indeed to me they are not a small one: for I take no more
of them than I please; for I hate task-reading, and I
diversify them at pleasure&mdash;sometimes a philosopher, sometimes
a poet&mdash;which change is not unpleasant nor disserviceable
neither; for what will more surely engrave upon my mind a
Tusculan disputation of Cicero's De Ægritudine Lenienda, than
an eclogue or georgick of Virgil's? The philosopher's wise man
and the poet's husbandman agree in peace of mind, in a liberty
and independency on fortune, and contempt of riches, power,
and glory. Every thing is placid and quiet in both: nothing
perturbed or disordered.</p>

<p>"These lines will, in my opinion, come nothing short of the
instruction of the finest sentence in Cicero: and is more to
me, as Virgil's life is more the subject of my ambition, being
what I can apprehend to be <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_15" id="Page_v1_15">[15]</a></span>more within my power. For the
perfectly wise man, that outbraves fortune, is surely greater
than the husbandman who slips by her; and, indeed, this
pastoral and saturnian happiness I have in a great measure
come at just now. I live like a king, pretty much by myself,
neither full of action nor perturbation,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">molles somnos</i>.
This state, however, I can foresee is not to be relied on. My
peace of mind is not sufficiently confirmed by philosophy to
withstand the blows of fortune. This greatness and elevation
of soul is to be found only in study and contemplation&mdash;this
can alone teach us to look down on human accidents. You must
allow [me] to talk thus, like a philosopher: 'tis a subject I
think much on, and could talk all day long of. But I know I
must not trouble you. Wherefore I wisely practise my rules,
which prescribe to check our appetite; and, for a
mortification, shall descend from these superior regions to
low and ordinary life; and so far as to tell you, <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_16" id="Page_v1_16">[16]</a></span>that John
has bought a horse: he thinks it neither cheap nor dear. It
cost six guineas, but will be sold cheaper against winter,
which he is not resolved on as yet. It has no fault, but
bogles a little. It is tolerably well favoured, and paces
naturally. Mamma bids me tell you, that Sir John Home is not
going to town; but he saw Eccles in the country, who says he
will do nothing in that affair, for he is only taking off old
adjudications, so it is needless to let him see the papers. He
desires you would trouble yourself to inquire about the
Earle's affairs, and advise us what to do in this affair.</p>

<p>"If it were not breaking the formal rule of connexions I have
prescribed myself in this letter&mdash;and it did not seem
unnatural to raise myself from so low affairs as horses and
papers, to so high and elevate things as books and study&mdash;I
would tell you that I read some of Longinus already, and that
I am mightily delighted with him. I think he does really
answer the character of being the great sublime he describes.
He delivers his precepts with such force, as if he were
enchanted with the subject; and is himself an author that may
be cited for an example to his own rules, by any one who shall
be so adventurous as to write upon his subject."<a name="FNanchor_16:1_14" id="FNanchor_16:1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_16:1_14" class="fnanchor">[16:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is certainly a remarkable letter to have been written by a youth
little more than sixteen years old. If it had been written by one less
distinguished by the <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_17" id="Page_v1_17">[17]</a></span>originality of his mature intellect, it might be
looked upon as one of those illustrations of the faculty of imitation,
for which some young persons display peculiar powers; but its grave and
high-toned philosophical feeling is evidently no echo of other people's
words, but the deeply felt sentiments of the writer. In some measure,
perhaps, he deceived himself in believing that he had attuned his mind
to pastoral simplicity, and had weeded it of all ambitious longings. If
he had a sympathy with Virgil, it was not, as he has represented, with
the poet's ideas of life, but with his realizations of it; not with the
quiet sphere of a retired and unnoticed existence, but with the lustre
of a well-earned fame. Through the whole, indeed, of the memorials of
Hume's early feelings, we find the traces of a bold and far-stretching
literary ambition; and though he believed that he had seared his mind to
ordinary human influences, it was because this one had become so
engrossing as to overwhelm all others. "I was seized very early," he
tells us, in his 'own life,' "with a passion for literature, which has
been the ruling passion of my life, and a great source of my
enjoyments." Joined to this impulse, we find a practical philosophy
partaking far more of the stoical than of that sceptical school with
which his metaphysical writings have identified him; a morality of
self-sacrifice and endurance, for the accomplishment of great ends. In
whatever light we may view his speculative opinions, we gather from the
habits of his life, and from the indications we possess of his passing
thoughts, that he devotedly acted up to the principle, that his genius
and power of application should be laid out with the greatest prospect
of permanent advantage to mankind. He was an economist of all his
talents from early youth: no memoir of a literary <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_18" id="Page_v1_18">[18]</a></span>man presents a more
cautious and vigilant husbandry of the mental powers and acquirements.
There is no instance of a man of genius who has wasted less in idleness
or in unavailing pursuits. Money was not his object, nor was temporary
fame; though, of the means of independent livelihood, and a good repute
among men, he never lost sight: but his ruling object of ambition,
pursued in poverty and riches, in health and sickness, in laborious
obscurity and amidst the blaze of fame, was to establish a permanent
name, resting on the foundation of literary achievements, likely to live
as long as human thought endured, and mental philosophy was studied.</p>

<p>There is among Hume's papers a fragment of "An Historical Essay on
Chivalry and Modern Honour." It is evidently a clean copy from a
corrected scrawl, written with great precision and neatness, and no
despicable specimen of caligraphy. From the pains that appear to have
been bestowed on the penmanship, and from many rhetorical defects and
blemishes which do not appear in any of his published works, it may be
inferred that this is a production of very early years, and properly
applicable to this period of his life; although its matured thought, and
clear systematic analysis, might, in other circumstances, have indicated
it as the fruit of a mind long and carefully cultivated. It is scarcely
necessary to frame an excuse for quoting such a document on the present
occasion. It could not be legitimately incorporated with his works;
because, whatever is given to the public in that shape, is presumed to
consist of those productions which the author himself, or those entitled
to represent him, have thought fit to lay before the public, as the
efforts by which the full stretch and compass of his intellectual powers
are to be tested. From such <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_19" id="Page_v1_19">[19]</a></span>collections, the editor who performs his
functions with a kind and respectful consideration for the reputation of
the illustrious dead, will exclude whatever is characterized by the
crudeness of youth, or the feebleness of superannuation. To the
reputation of Hume it would be peculiarly unjust to publish among his
acknowledged and printed works, any productions of extreme youth;
because, from his earliest years to an advanced period of his life, his
mind was characterized by constant improvement, and he was every now and
then reaching a point from which he looked back with regret and
disapprobation at the efforts of earlier years.</p>

<p>But in a biographical work, where the chief object is the tracing the
history of the author's mind, not the representation of its matured
efforts, these early specimens of budding genius have their legitimate
place, and receive that charitable consideration for the circumstances
in which they were written, which their author's reputation demands.</p>

<p>The essay commences with a sketch of the decline of virtue, and the
prevalence of luxury among the Romans; and describes their possession of
the arts which they had learned in their better days, when not seconded
by bravery and enterprise, as furnishing, like the fine clothes of a
soldier, a temptation to hostile cupidity. He then represents the
conquerors adapting themselves, after the manner peculiar to their own
barbarous state, to the habits and ideas of the civilized people whom
they had subdued. He represents the conquered people as sunk in
indolence, but imperfectly preserving the arts and elegancies
transmitted to them by their ancestors; and the conquerors full of
energy and activity, as the sources of whatever impulse was thereafter
given to <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_20" id="Page_v1_20">[20]</a></span>thought or action. They "came with freshness and alacrity to
the business; and being encouraged both by the novelty of these subjects
and by the success of their arms, would naturally ingraft some new kind
of fruit on the ancient stock." He then proceeds with the following
train of reflections:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'Tis observable of the human mind, that when it is smit with
any idea of merit or perfection beyond what its faculties can
attain, and in the pursuit of which it uses not reason and
experience for its guide, it knows no mean, but as it gives
the rein, and even adds the spur, to every florid conceit or
fancy, runs in a moment quite wide of nature. Thus we find,
when, without discretion, it indulges its devote terrors, that
working in such fairy-ground, it quickly buries itself in its
own whimsies and chimeras, and raises up to itself a new set
of passions, affections, desires, objects, and, in short, a
perfectly new world of its own, inhabited by different beings,
and regulated by different laws from this of ours. In this new
world 'tis so possessed that it can endure no interruption
from the old; but as nature is apt still on every occasion to
recall it thither, it must undermine it by art, and retiring
altogether from the commerce of mankind, if it be so bent upon
its religious exercise, from the mystic, by an easy
transition, degenerate into the hermite. The same thing is
observable in philosophy, which though it cannot produce a
different world in which we may wander, makes us act in this
as if we were different beings from the rest of mankind; at
least makes us frame to ourselves, though we cannot execute
them, rules of conduct different from those which are set to
us by nature. No engine can supply the place of wings, and
make us fly, though the <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_21" id="Page_v1_21">[21]</a></span>imagination of such a one may make us
stretch and strain and elevate ourselves upon our tiptoes. And
in this case of an imagined merit, the farther our chimeras
hurry us from nature, and the practice of the world, the
better pleased we are, as valuing ourselves upon the
singularity of our notions, and thinking we depart from the
rest of mankind only by flying above them. Where there is none
we excel, we are apt to think we have no excellency; and
self-conceit makes us take every singularity for an
excellency.</p>

<p>"When, therefore, these barbarians came first to the relish of
some degree of virtue and politeness beyond what they had ever
before been acquainted with, their minds would necessarily
stretch themselves into some vast conceptions of things,
which, not being corrected by sufficient judgment and
experience, must be empty and unsolid. Those who had first
bred these conceptions in them could not assist them in their
birth, as the Grecians did the Romans; but being themselves
scarce half civilized, would be rather apt to entertain any
extravagant misshapen conceit of their conquerors, than able
to lick it into any form. 'Twas thus that that monster of
romantic chivalry, or knight-errantry, by the necessary
operation of the principles of human nature, was brought into
the world; and it is remarkable that it descended from the
Moors and Arabians, who, learning somewhat of the Roman
civility from the province they conquered, and being
themselves a southern people, which are commonly observed to
be more quick and inventive than the northern, were the first
who fell upon this vein of achievement. When it was once
broken upon it ran like wild-fire over all the nations of
Europe, who, being in the same situation with these nations,
kindled with the least spark.</p>

<p><!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_22" id="Page_v1_22">[22]</a></span>"What kind of monstrous birth this of chivalry must prove, we
may learn from considering the different revolutions in the
arts, particularly in architecture, and comparing the Gothic
with the Grecian models of it. The one are plain, simple, and
regular, but withal majestic and beautiful, which when these
barbarians unskilfully imitated, they ran into a wild
profusion of ornaments, and by their rude embellishments
departed far from nature and a just simplicity. They were
struck with the beauties of the ancient buildings; but,
ignorant how to preserve a just mean, and giving an unbounded
liberty to their fancy in heaping ornament upon ornament, they
made the whole a heap of confusion and irregularity. For the
same reason, when they would rear up a new scheme of manners,
or heroism, it must be strangely overcharged with ornaments,
and no part exempt from their unskilful refinements; and this
we find to have been actually the case, as may be proven by
running over the several parts of it."</p>
</div>

<p>He then inquires into the reason, why courage is the principal virtue of
barbarous nations, and why they esteem deeds of heroism, however useless
or mischievous, as far more meritorious than useful efforts of
government or internal organization. He contrasts the heroism of the
barbarous periods of the ancient world, with those of the dark ages of
modern Europe; and finding the former selfish and aggrandizing, while
the latter is characterized by the more generous features of chivalry,
he thus accounts for this characteristic.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The method by which these courteous knights acquired this
extreme civility of theirs, was by mixing love with their
courage. Love is a very generous passion, and well fitted both
to that humanity and <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_23" id="Page_v1_23">[23]</a></span>courage they would reconcile. The only
one that can contest with it is friendship, which, besides
that it is too refined a passion for common use, is not by
many degrees so natural as love, to which almost every one has
a great propensity, and which it is impossible to see a
beautiful woman, without feeling some touches of. Besides, as
love is a capricious passion, it is the more susceptible of
these fantastic forms, which it must take when it mixes with
chivalry. Friendship is a solid and serious thing, and, like
the love of their country in the Roman heroes, would dispel
and put to flight all the chimeras, inseparable from this
spirit of adventure. So that a mistress is as necessary to a
cavalier or knight-errant, as a god or saint to a devotee. Nor
would he stop here, or be contented with a submiss reverence
and adoration to one of the sex, but would extend in some
degree the same civility to the whole, and by a curious
reversement of the order of nature, make them the superior.
This is no more than what is suitable to that infinite
generosity of which he makes profession. Every thing below him
he treats with submission, and every thing above him, with
contumacy. Thus he carries these double symptoms of generosity
which Virgil makes mention of into extravagance.</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hence arises the knight-errant's strong and irreconcileable
aversion to all giants, with his most humble and respectful
submission to all damsels. These two affections of his, he
unites in all his adventures, which are always designed to
relieve distressed damsels from the captivity and violence of
giants.</p>

<p>"As a cavalier is composed of the greatest warmth of love,
tempered with the most humble submission <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_24" id="Page_v1_24">[24]</a></span>and respect, his
mistress's behaviour is in every point the reverse of this;
and what is conspicuous in her temper is the utmost coldness
along with the greatest haughtiness and disdain; until at
last, gratitude for the many deliverances she has met with,
and the giants and monsters without number that he has
destroyed for her sake, reduces her, though unwilling, to the
necessity of commencing a bride. Here the chastity of women,
which, from the necessity of human affairs, has been in all
ages and countries an extravagant point of honour with them,
is run into still greater extravagance, that none of the sexes
may be exempt from this fantastic ornament.</p>

<p>"Such were the notions of bravery in that age, and such the
fictions by which they formed models of it. The effects these
had on their ordinary life and conversation was, first, an
extravagant gallantry and adoration of the whole female sex,
and romantic notions of extraordinary constancy, fidelity, and
refined passion for one mistress. Secondly, the introduction
of the practice of single combat. How naturally this sprung up
from chivalry may easily be understood. A knight-errant
fights, not like another man full of passion and resentment,
but with the utmost civility mixed with his undaunted courage.
He salutes you before he cuts your throat; and a plain man,
who understood nothing of the mystery, would take him for a
treacherous ruffian, and think that, like Judas, he was
betraying with a kiss, while he is showing his generous
calmness and amicable courage. In consequence of this, every
thing is performed with the greatest ceremony and order; and
whenever either chance or his superior bravery make either of
them victorious, he generously gives his antagonist his life,
and again embraces him as his friend. When these fantastic
<!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_25" id="Page_v1_25">[25]</a></span>practices have come in use, the amazed world, who, merely
because there is nothing real in all this, must certainly
imagine there is a great deal, could not but look upon such a
courteous enmity as the most heroic and sublime thing in
nature; and instead of punishing any murder that might ensue,
as the law directs in such cases, would praise and applaud the
murderer."<a name="FNanchor_25:1_15" id="FNanchor_25:1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_25:1_15" class="fnanchor">[25:1]</a></p>
</div>


<p><!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_26" id="Page_v1_26">[26]</a></span>Perhaps the reader of these passages will have come to the conclusion
that the powers of reason displayed in them are as bold and original as
the imagination is meagre and servile. The reflections on Gothic
architecture are the commonplace opinions of the day, uttered by one who
was singularly destitute of sympathy with the human intellect, in its
early efforts to resolve itself into symmetry and elegance; whose mind
shrunk from the contemplation of any work of man that did not bear the
stamp of high intellectual culture. The same want of sympathy with man
in his rude and grand, though inharmonious efforts, here attends both
the chivalric manners and the solemn architecture of the dark ages. Of
the former, he has made a cold, clear, unsympathizing, perhaps accurate
estimate. The latter, unless a large proportion of the architectural
enthusiasts of the present day have raised the taste of the age upon
false foundations, he utterly misappreciated.</p>

<p>It must have been about his seventeenth year that Hume commenced, and
abruptly relinquished the practical study of the law,&mdash;a curious episode
in his history, which he thus describes in his "own life:" "My studious
disposition, my sobriety, and my industry, gave my family a notion that
the law was a proper profession for me; but I found an insurmountable
aversion to every thing but the pursuits of philosophy and general
learning; and while they fancied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius,
Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was secretly devouring."</p>

<p>But this by no means gives the reader a full and faithful impression of
his motives. The passage calls up the vision of a contemplative, gentle,
unambitious youth, shrinking from the arid labours that lead to wealth
and distinction, and content to dream away <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_27" id="Page_v1_27">[27]</a></span>his life in obscurity with
the companionship of his favourite books. The document already referred
to, and immediately to be quoted, shows that far other thoughts were in
his mind; that he did not shrink from the professional labours of the
bar, to sink into studious ease, but rejected them to encounter higher
and more arduous toils&mdash;that he did not drop passively from the path of
ambition opened to him, but deserted it for a higher and more
adventurous course. He had indeed already before him the prospect of
being a discoverer in philosophy, and his mind, crowded with the images
of his new system, could see nothing else in life worthy of pursuit.</p>

<p>Without this clue, Hume's aversion to the study of the law would have
been a problem not to be easily solved. Had he lived in the present day,
when the mass of statute and precedent that have accumulated even within
the narrow domain of Scottish law, have completely precluded those
luxurious digressions into the field of speculation and theory, which
characterized the legal practice of our ancestors, one might readily
comprehend the aversion of his fastidiously cultivated logical mind to
such hard and coarse materials. But a lawyer's library, in his days,
consisted of the classics, the philosophers of mind, and the civilians.
The advocate often commenced his pleadings with a quotation from the
young philosopher's favourite poet Virgil, and then digressed into a
speculative inquiry into the general principles of law and government:
the philosophical genius of Themis long soaring sublime, until at last,
folding her wings, she rested on some vulgar question about dry multures
or an irritancy of a tailzie, to the settlement of which the wide
principles so announced were applied. Surely that science, within the
boundaries of which <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_28" id="Page_v1_28">[28]</a></span>the speculative spirit of Lord Kames had room for
its flights, could not have been rejected on the ground that it cramped
and restrained the faculty of generalizing.<a name="FNanchor_28:1_16" id="FNanchor_28:1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_28:1_16" class="fnanchor">[28:1]</a> Yet in a letter to
Smith, of 12th April, 1759, which shows that Hume retained his antipathy
to the study to an advanced period of his life, he says, "I am afraid of
Kames' Law Tracts. A man might as well think of making a fine sauce by a
mixture of wormwood and aloes, as an agreeable composition by joining
metaphysics and Scottish law. However, the book I believe has merit,
though few people will take the pains of inquiring into it."</p>

<p>In truth there appear to have been in Hume all the elements of which a
good lawyer is made: clearness of judgment, power of rapidly acquiring
knowledge, untiring industry, and dialectic skill; and, if his mind had
not been preoccupied, he might have fallen into that gulf in which many
of the world's greatest geniuses lie buried&mdash;professional eminence, and
might have left behind him a reputation limited to the traditional
recollections of the Parliament House, or associated with important
decisions. He was through life an able, clear-headed man of business,
and I have seen several legal documents written in his own hand and
evidently drawn by himself. They stand the test of general professional
observation; and <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_29" id="Page_v1_29">[29]</a></span>their writer, by preparing documents of such a
character on his own responsibility, showed that he had considerable
confidence in his ability to adhere to the forms adequate for the
occasion. He talks of it as "an ancient prejudice industriously
propagated by the dunces in all countries, that <em>a man of genius is
unfit for business</em>;"<a name="FNanchor_29:1_17" id="FNanchor_29:1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_29:1_17" class="fnanchor">[29:1]</a> and he showed, in his general conduct
through life, that he did not choose to come voluntarily under this
proscription.</p>

<p>His writings, however, bear but slight traces of his juridical studies.
In analysing the foundations of our notions of property, he criticises
some of the subtleties of the early civilians, but shows no more
intimate acquaintance with their works than any well-informed scholar of
the day might be supposed to exhibit. He shows no pleasure in dwelling
on matters connected with this study, but rather appears disposed to
release himself and his reader from a subject so little congenial to his
taste. The particular law of Scotland is one of those subjects to which
he would be careful to avoid a reference, as carrying with it that tone
of provincial thought and education which he was always anxious to
avoid. It may be perhaps an unfortunate result of this early prejudice
against the study of jurisprudence, that in after life he failed to
acquire that knowledge of the progress of the law of England, which
would have made his history much less amenable than it has been to
censorious criticism.</p>

<p>It is now time that the reader should be possessed of the document above
alluded to, as throwing much light on Hume's early studies and habits of
life; and it is here presented, without any introductory explanation, as
it first appeared to me in going through the papers in the possession of
the Royal Society.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Not being acquainted with this handwriting, you will
probably look to the bottom to find the subscription, and not
finding any, will certainly wonder at this strange method of
addressing to you. I must here in the beginning beg you to
excuse it, and, to persuade you to read what follows with some
attention, must tell you, that this gives you an opportunity
to do a very good-natured action, which I believe is the most
powerful argument I can use. I need not tell you, that I am
your countryman, a Scotsman; for without any such tie, I dare
rely upon your humanity even to a perfect stranger, such as I
am. The favour I beg of you is your advice, and the reason why
I address myself in particular to you, need not be told,&mdash;as
one must be a skilful physician, a man of letters, of wit, of
good sense, and of great humanity, to give me a satisfying
answer. I wish fame had pointed out to me more persons, in
whom these qualities are united, in order to have kept me some
time in suspense. This I say in the sincerity of my heart, and
without any intention of making a compliment; for though it
may seem necessary, that, in the beginning of so unusual a
letter, I should say some fine things, to bespeak your good
opinion, and remove any prejudices you may conceive at it, yet
such an endeavour to be witty, would ill suit with the present
condition of my mind; which, I must confess, is not without
anxiety concerning the judgment you will form of me. Trusting,
however, to your candour and generosity, I shall, without
further preface, proceed to open up to you the present
condition of my health, and to do that the more effectually,
shall give you a kind of history of my life, after which you
will easily learn why I keep my name a secret.</p>

<p><!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_31" id="Page_v1_31">[31]</a></span>"You must know then that, from my earliest infancy, I found
always a strong inclination to books and letters. As our
college education in Scotland, extending little further than
the languages, ends commonly when we are about fourteen or
fifteen years of age, I was after that left to my own choice
in my reading, and found it incline me almost equally to books
of reasoning and philosophy, and to poetry and the polite
authors. Every one who is acquainted either with the
philosophers or critics, knows that there is nothing yet
established in either of these two sciences, and that they
contain little more than endless disputes, even in the most
fundamental articles. Upon examination of these, I found a
certain boldness of temper growing in me, which was not
inclined to submit to any authority in these subjects, but led
me to seek out some new medium, by which truth might be
established. After much study and reflection on this, at last,
when I was about eighteen years of age, there seemed to be
opened up to me a new scene of thought, which transported me
beyond measure, and made me, with an ardour natural to young
men, throw up every other pleasure or business to apply
entirely to it. The law, which was the business I designed to
follow, appeared nauseous to me, and I could think of no other
way of pushing my fortune in the world, but that of a scholar
and philosopher. I was infinitely happy in this course of life
for some months; till at last, about the beginning of
September, 1729, all my ardour seemed in a moment to be
extinguished, and I could no longer raise my mind to that
pitch, which formerly gave me such excessive pleasure. I felt
no uneasiness or want of spirits, when I laid aside my book;
and therefore never imagined there was any bodily distemper in
the case, but that my coldness <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_32" id="Page_v1_32">[32]</a></span>proceeded from a laziness of
temper, which must be overcome by redoubling my application.
In this condition I remained for nine months, very uneasy to
myself, as you may well imagine, but without growing any
worse, which was a miracle. There was another particular,
which contributed, more than any thing, to waste my spirits
and bring on me this distemper, which was, that having read
many books of morality, such as Cicero, Seneca, and Plutarch,
and being smit with their beautiful representations of virtue
and philosophy, I undertook the improvement of my temper and
will, along with my reason and understanding. I was
continually fortifying myself with reflections against death,
and poverty, and shame, and pain, and all the other calamities
of life. These no doubt are exceeding useful, when joined with
an active life, because the occasion being presented along
with the reflection, works it into the soul, and makes it take
a deep impression; but in solitude they serve to little other
purpose, than to waste the spirits, the force of the mind
meeting with no resistance, but wasting itself in the air,
like our arm when it misses its aim. This, however, I did not
learn but by experience, and till I had already ruined my
health, though I was not sensible of it. Some scurvy spots
broke out on my fingers the first winter I fell ill, about
which I consulted a very knowing physician, who gave me some
medicine that removed these symptoms, and at the same time
gave me a warning against the vapours, which, though I was
labouring under at that time, I fancied myself so far removed
from, and indeed from any other disease, except a slight
scurvy, that I despised his warning. At last, about April
1730, when I was nineteen years of age, a symptom, which I had
noticed a little from the beginning, increased <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_33" id="Page_v1_33">[33]</a></span>considerably;
so that, though it was no uneasiness, the novelty of it made
me ask advice; it was what they call a ptyalism or wateryness
in the mouth. Upon my mentioning it to my physician, he
laughed at me, and told me I was now a brother, for that I had
fairly got the disease of the learned. Of this he found great
difficulty to persuade me, finding in myself nothing of that
lowness of spirit, which those who labour under that distemper
so much complain of. However upon his advice I went under a
course of bitters, and anti-hysteric pills, drank an English
pint of claret wine every day, and rode eight or ten Scotch
miles. This I continued for about seven months after.</p>

<p>"Though I was sorry to find myself engaged with so tedious a
distemper, yet the knowledge of it set me very much at ease,
by satisfying me that my former coldness proceeded not from
any defect of temper or genius, but from a disease to which
any one may be subject. I now began to take some indulgence to
myself; studied moderately, and only when I found my spirits
at their highest pitch, leaving off before I was weary, and
trifling away the rest of my time in the best manner I could.
In this way, I lived with satisfaction enough; and on my
return to town next winter found my spirits very much
recruited, so that, though they sank under me in the higher
flights of genius, yet I was able to make considerable
progress in my former designs. I was very regular in my diet
and way of life from the beginning, and all that winter made
it a constant rule to ride twice or thrice a-week, and walk
every day. For these reasons, I expected, when I returned to
the country, and could renew my exercise with less
interruption, that I would perfectly recover. But in this I
was much mistaken; for next summer, about May 1731, there grew
upon me a very <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_34" id="Page_v1_34">[34]</a></span>ravenous appetite, and as quick a digestion,
which I at first took for a good symptom, and was very much
surprised to find it bring back a palpitation of heart, which
I had felt very little of before. This appetite, however, had
an effect very unusual, which was to nourish me extremely; so
that in six weeks' time, I passed from the one extreme to the
other; and being before tall, lean, and raw-boned, became on a
sudden the most sturdy, robust, healthful-like fellow you have
seen, with a ruddy complexion and a cheerful countenance. In
excuse for my riding, and care of my health, I always said
that I was afraid of consumption, which was readily believed
from my looks, but now every body congratulated me upon my
thorough recovery. This unnatural appetite wore off by
degrees, but left me as a legacy the same palpitation of the
heart in a small degree, and a good deal of wind in my
stomach, which comes away easily, and without any bad <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goût</i>,
as is ordinary. However, these symptoms are little or no
uneasiness to me. I eat well; I sleep well; have no lowness of
spirits, at least never more than what one of the best health
may feel from too full a meal, from sitting too near a fire,
and even that degree I feel very seldom, and never almost in
the morning or forenoon. Those who live in the same family
with me, and see me at all times, cannot observe the least
alteration in my humour, and rather think me a better
companion than I was before, as choosing to pass more of my
time with them. This gave me such hopes, that I scarce ever
missed a day's riding, except in the winter time; and last
summer undertook a very laborious task, which was to travel
eight miles every morning, and as many in the forenoon, to and
from a mineral well of some reputation. I renewed the bitter
and anti-hysteric pills twice, <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_35" id="Page_v1_35">[35]</a></span>along with anti-scorbutic
juice, last spring, but without any considerable effect,
except abating the symptoms for a little time.</p>

<p>"Thus I have given you a full account of the condition of my
body; and without staying to ask pardon, as I ought to do, for
so tedious a story, shall explain to you how my mind stood all
this time, which on every occasion, especially in this
distemper, have a very near connexion together. Having now
time and leisure to cool my inflamed imagination, I began to
consider seriously how I should proceed in my philosophical
inquiries. I found that the moral philosophy transmitted to us
by antiquity laboured under the same inconvenience that has
been found in their natural philosophy, of being entirely
hypothetical, and depending more upon invention than
experience: every one consulted his fancy in erecting schemes
of virtue and of happiness, without regarding human nature,
upon which every moral conclusion must depend. This,
therefore, I resolved to make my principal study, and the
source from which I would derive every truth in criticism as
well as morality. I believe it is a certain fact, that most of
the philosophers who have gone before us, have been overthrown
by the greatness of their genius, and that little more is
required to make a man succeed in this study, than to throw
off all prejudices either for his own opinions or for those of
others. At least this is all I have to depend on for the truth
of my reasonings, which I have multiplied to such a degree,
that within these three years, I find I have scribbled many a
quire of paper, in which there is nothing contained but my own
inventions. This, with the reading most of the celebrated
books in Latin, French, and English, and acquiring the
Italian, you may think a sufficient <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_36" id="Page_v1_36">[36]</a></span>business for one in
perfect health, and so it would had it been done to any
purpose; but my disease was a cruel encumbrance on me. I found
that I was not able to follow out any train of thought, by one
continued stretch of view, but by repeated interruptions, and
by refreshing my eye from time to time upon other objects. Yet
with this inconvenience I have collected the rude materials
for many volumes; but in reducing these to words, when one
must bring the idea he comprehended in gross, nearer to him,
so as to contemplate its minutest parts, and keep it steadily
in his eye, so as to copy these parts in order,&mdash;this I found
impracticable for me, nor were my spirits equal to so severe
an employment. Here lay my greatest calamity. I had no hopes
of delivering my opinions with such elegance and neatness, as
to draw to me the attention of the world, and I would rather
live and die in obscurity than produce them maimed and
imperfect.</p>

<p>"Such a miserable disappointment I scarce ever remember to
have heard of. The small distance betwixt me and perfect
health makes me the more uneasy in my present situation. It is
a weakness rather than a lowness of spirits which troubles me,
and there seems to be as great a difference betwixt my
distemper and common vapours, as betwixt vapours and madness.
I have noticed in the writings of the French mystics, and in
those of our fanatics here, that when they give a history of
the situation of their souls, they mention a coldness and
desertion of the spirit, which frequently returns; and some of
them, at the beginning, have been tormented with it many
years. As this kind of devotion depends entirely on the force
of passion, and consequently of the animal spirits, I have
often thought that their case and mine <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_37" id="Page_v1_37">[37]</a></span>were pretty parallel,
and that their rapturous admirations might discompose the
fabric of the nerves and brain, as much as profound
reflections, and that warmth or enthusiasm which is
inseparable from them.</p>

<p>"However this may be, I have not come out of the cloud so well
as they commonly tell us they have done, or rather began to
despair of ever recovering. To keep myself from being
melancholy on so dismal a prospect, my only security was in
peevish reflections on the vanity of the world and of all
human glory; which, however just sentiments they may be
esteemed, I have found can never be sincere, except in those
who are possessed of them. Being sensible that all my
philosophy would never make me contented in my present
situation, I began to rouse up myself; and being encouraged by
instances of recovery from worse degrees of this distemper, as
well as by the assurances of my physicians, I began to think
of something more effectual than I had hitherto tried. I
found, that as there are two things very bad for this
distemper, study and idleness, so there are two things very
good, business and diversion; and that my whole time was spent
betwixt the bad, with little or no share of the good. For this
reason I resolved to seek out a more active life, and though I
could not quit my pretensions in learning but with my last
breath, to lay them aside for some time, in order the more
effectually to resume them. Upon examination, I found my
choice confined to two kinds of life, that of a travelling
governor, and that of a merchant. The first, besides that it
is in some respects an idle life, was, I found, unfit for me;
and that because from a sedentary and retired way of living,
from a bashful temper, and from a narrow fortune, I had been
little accustomed to general <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_38" id="Page_v1_38">[38]</a></span>companies, and had not
confidence and knowledge enough of the world to push my
fortune, or to be serviceable in that way. I therefore fixed
my choice upon a merchant; and having got recommendation to a
considerable trader in Bristol, I am just now hastening
thither, with a resolution to forget myself, and every thing
that is past, to engage myself, as far as is possible, in that
course of life, and to toss about the world, from the one pole
to the other, till I leave this distemper behind me.</p>

<p>"As I am come to London in my way to Bristol, I have resolved,
if possible, to get your advice, though I should take this
absurd method of procuring it. All the physicians I have
consulted, though very able, could never enter into my
distemper; because not being persons of great learning beyond
their own profession, they were unacquainted with these
motions of the mind. Your fame pointed you out as the
properest person to resolve my doubts, and I was determined to
have somebody's opinion, which I could rest upon in all the
varieties of fears and hopes, incident to so lingering a
distemper. I hope I have been particular enough in describing
the symptoms to allow you to form a judgment; or rather,
perhaps, have been too particular. But you know it is a
symptom of this distemper, to delight in complaining and
talking of itself. The questions I would humbly propose to you
are: Whether, among all those scholars you have been
acquainted with, you have ever known any affected in this
manner? Whether I can ever hope for a recovery? Whether I must
long wait for it? Whether my recovery will ever be perfect,
and my spirits regain their former spring and vigour, so as to
endure the fatigue of deep and abstruse thinking? Whether I
have taken a right <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_39" id="Page_v1_39">[39]</a></span>way to recover? I believe all proper
medicines have been used, and therefore I need mention nothing
of them."</p>
</div>

<p>The history of this eventful period in the mental biography of Hume, is
very briefly narrated in his "own life." Alluding to his adoption of the
life of a student, he says, "My very slender fortune, however, being
unsuitable to this plan of life, and my health being a little broken by
my ardent application, I was tempted, or rather forced, to make a very
feeble trial for entering into a more active scene of life. In 1734, I
went to Bristol, with some recommendations to eminent merchants, but in
a few months found that scene totally unsuitable to me."</p>

<p>I am sure the reader will sympathize with me in esteeming it a high
privilege to be the humble instrument of ushering into the world so
curious a piece of literary autobiography as that which he has just
perused. We are here admitted into the confessional. So secret is the
communication of thought by the writer to the receiver, that the latter,
who was made acquainted with so much of the internal meditations of the
former, was not to be allowed to know with what outward man this mind of
which he obtained a description was connected. The individual mind was
fully and minutely described&mdash;to what individual man this mind belonged
was to be preserved a profound secret. The writer shrunk from the
admission of any man to a participation with him in his
self-conferences, and he planned that by keeping his name a secret, the
link which would connect this knowledge of the inner to an acquaintance
with the outer man should be broken. We have surely in this an argument
in favour of the candour and explicitness of his narrative. He felt that
to be known, in the ordinary <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_40" id="Page_v1_40">[40]</a></span>acceptation of the term, by the person he
addressed, would be a restraint on the freedom of his revelations&mdash;he
threw off this restraint, and we are entitled to infer that his letter
is a piece of full and candid self-examination. Every word of it, as it
was originally written, is here printed, and it will perhaps be admitted
that there is not one word of it that does not do honour to its writer.
To Aristotle and others it is attributed that they taught esoteric
doctrines to a chosen few&mdash;doctrines not to be promulgated to the world
at large, because they were likely to have a dangerous influence on
minds not skilfully trained for their reception. For any vestiges of
these hidden doctrines the world searches, anticipating that in them
will be found a nearer approach to that which the philosopher believed
in his own mind, as distinct from that which he desired to inculcate on
others. In all ages there has been a natural and a praiseworthy
curiosity to know the hidden thoughts of great teachers. Mankind in
general admit, that truth is what is valuable in all philosophy, and if
a man entertained thoughts in his own mind in any way different from
those which he taught, it has been a conclusion certainly quite
legitimate, that truth is more likely to be found in the former than in
the latter. But certainly there can hardly be found any other instance
in which a document, so likely to be the honest impress of a
philosopher's own mind, has been laid before the world; and it is an
attestation of the sincerity with which the opinions then in the course
of formation in his mind were believed.</p>

<p>But, independently of the philosophical value of the document, to be
thus admitted into the secrecy of the thoughts of a man ambitious of
high literary distinction, and who has attained his object, is a rare
privilege. The revelation, notwithstanding its foreboding <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_41" id="Page_v1_41">[41]</a></span>tone, is
calculated to give far more pleasure than pain. The future, which seemed
to the desponding philosopher for a moment so dark, we know to have
brightened on him. Hume was of the happy few who lived to see their airy
castles substantially realized. Comparing what it reveals of the inner
man, with the subsequent history of his achievements, the picture
supplied by this fragment of autobiography is a happy one. We sympathize
with the aspiring dreams of the young man, without feeling that they
were afterwards doomed to disappointment. The immediate occasion of his
earnest appeal is undoubtedly one of despondency; but it was preceded by
hope, as we know it was followed by success; and notwithstanding this
passing cloud, it may fairly be pronounced, that though Hume enjoyed
through life more than the average portion of human happiness, he had no
moments of purer felicity than those in which, in the retirement of his
paternal home, he was sketching the airy outline of his subsequent
career.</p>

<p>Perhaps the feature that will most forcibly strike the reader, is the
evidence of the deep-rooted ambition to found a philosophical
reputation, that seems to have filled the mind of the writer of this
document. The consciousness that the receiver of the paper must at once
perceive this circumstance, and the desire not to let a stranger
penetrate his aspiring thoughts, must have been the reasons of his
desire for secrecy: it was natural that one who had not entered the
lists to struggle for literary distinction, should wish to conceal how
strong and inextinguishable was his desire to obtain the prize. The
intensity of his anxiety on this subject seems to have made him, in
relation to his mind, what the ordinary hypochondriac is as to his
physical constitution. The desire to preserve the elements of
<!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_42" id="Page_v1_42">[42]</a></span>distinction was so intense, that it disturbed him with vain fears for
their disappearance. Feeling within him, at times, the consciousness of
possessing an original genius,&mdash;that it should depart from him, and that
his lot should be cast among that of ordinary mortals, with good
physical health and commonplace abilities, appeared to him the most
awful calamity which fate could have in store for him. Of the excellent
physical health which accompanied these unpleasant variations of his
mental capacity, he speaks with an almost sardonic scorn, as one who, in
the bitterness of being bereft of what is all in all to him, talks of
some paltry trifle which fortune in her sarcastic malice has chosen to
leave untouched. In short, the manner in which he speaks of the
departure of his cunning, must almost necessarily convey to the reader a
considerable portion of that ludicrous character which is always
presented by a scene in which a man appears to be dreadfully anxious
about the safety of that which either is of no importance, or is not in
danger.</p>

<p>It may be a question whether this strange letter was ever sent to its
destination, as the version from which it is here printed is not a rough
draught, but a neatly written copy, such as might have been prepared for
transmission. But this does not afford so full a presumption in Hume's
case, as it would in that of the average of literary men, as he seems to
have felt a sort of enjoyment in his earlier years in having his papers
neatly written out. The first name that suggested itself as that of the
person to whom the paper was addressed was Arbuthnot, whose fine genius
was just then flickering in the socket. But a more full consideration
showed to my satisfaction that it must have been destined for Dr. George
Cheyne, <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_43" id="Page_v1_43">[43]</a></span>and that it was suggested by that eminent physician's
publication, in the preceding year, of "The English Malady; or, a
Treatise of Nervous Diseases of all kinds, as Spleen, Vapours, Lowness
of Spirits, Hypochondriacal Distempers, &amp;c." There is a certain unison
of tone between Hume's letter and this book, that, added to other
coincidences, strongly impresses on the mind their connexion with each
other; and though it is perhaps necessary, before this is fully seen, to
enter into the whole tenor and tone of Cheyne's book, the reader will
perhaps find the following passage sufficient to render the conjecture
probable:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a common observation, (and I think has great probability on its
side,) that fools, weak or stupid persons, heavy and dull souls, are
seldom much troubled with vapours or lowness of spirits. The
intellectual faculty, without all manner of doubt, has material and
animal organs, by which it mediately works, as well as the animal
functions. What they are, and how they operate, as I believe very few
know, so it is very little necessary to know them for my present
purpose. As a philosophical musician may understand proportions and
harmony, and yet never be in a condition to gratify a company with a
fine piece of music, without the benefit of sounds from proper organs,
so the intellectual operations (as long as the present union between
soul and body lasts) can never be performed in the best manner without
proper instruments. The works of imagination and memory, of study,
thinking, and reflecting, from whatever source the principle on which
they depend springs, must necessarily require bodily organs. Some have
these organs finer, quicker, more agile, and sensible, and perhaps more
numerous than others; brute animals have few or none, at least none that
belong to reflection; <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_44" id="Page_v1_44">[44]</a></span>vegetables certainly none at all. There is no
account to be given how a disease, a fall, a blow, a debauch, poisons,
violent passions, astral and aerial influences, much application, and
the like, should possibly alter or destroy these intellectual operations
without this supposition. It is evident, that in nervous distempers, and
a great many other bodily diseases, these faculties and their operations
are impaired, nay, totally ruined and extinguished to all appearance;
and yet, by proper remedies, and after recovery of health, they are
restored and brought to their former state. Now, since this present age
has made efforts to go beyond former times, in all the arts of
ingenuity, invention, study, learning, and all the contemplative and
sedentary professions, (I speak only here of our own nation, our own
times, and of the better sort, whose chief employments and studies these
are,) the organs of these faculties being thereby worn and spoiled, must
affect and deaden the whole system, and lay a foundation for the
diseases of lowness and weakness. Add to this, that those who are
likeliest to excel and apply in this manner, are most capable and most
in hazard of following that way of life which I have mentioned, as the
likeliest to produce these diseases. Great wits are generally great
epicures, at least, men of taste. And the bodies and constitutions of
one generation are still more corrupt, infirm, and diseased, than those
of the former, as they advance in time and the use of the causes
assigned."</p>

<p>Then there are the farther coincidences, that Cheyne was a Scotsman,
that he was an eminent man in his profession, and that he had bestowed
some attention on mental philosophy. "I passed my youth," he tells us,
"in close study, and almost constant application to the abstracted
sciences, wherein my chief pleasure <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_45" id="Page_v1_45">[45]</a></span>consisted." "Having," he elsewhere
says, "had a liberal education, with the instruction and example of
pious parents, (who at first had designed me for the church,) I had
preserved a firm persuasion of the great and fundamental principles of
all virtue and morality: viz. the existence of a supreme and infinitely
perfect Being, the freedom of the will, the immortality of the spirits
of all intellectual beings, and the certainty of future rewards or
punishments. These doctrines I had examined carefully, and had been
confirmed in, from abstracted reasonings, as well as from the best
natural philosophy, and some clearer knowledge of the material system of
the world in general, and the wisdom, fitness, and beautiful contrivance
of particular things animated and inanimated; so that the truth and
necessity of these principles was so riveted in me, (which may be seen
by the first edition of my 'Philosophical Principles,' published some
years before that happened,<a name="FNanchor_45:1_18" id="FNanchor_45:1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:1_18" class="fnanchor">[45:1]</a>) as never after to be shaken in all my
wanderings and follies."<a name="FNanchor_45:2_19" id="FNanchor_45:2_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:2_19" class="fnanchor">[45:2]</a> It may <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_46" id="Page_v1_46">[46]</a></span>be mentioned also, as a
circumstance likely to bring Cheyne's work early under Hume's
observation, that it contains a long statement of the case of Dr.
William <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_47" id="Page_v1_47">[47]</a></span>Cranstoun, an eminent medical man then residing at Jedburgh, in
the same district of country with Ninewells.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4:1_5" id="Footnote_4:1_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4:1_5"><span class="label">[4:1]</span></a> In connexion with this, it is not uninteresting to view
Hume's opinions on the philosophy of family pride. He says, in the
Treatise of Human Nature, Book ii. p. i. sect. 9.&mdash;"'Tis evident that,
when any one boasts of the antiquity of his family, the subjects of his
vanity are not merely the extent of time and number of ancestors, but
also their riches and credit, which are supposed to reflect a lustre on
himself on account of his relation to them. He first considers these
objects; is affected by them in an agreeable manner; and then returning
back to himself, through the relation of parent and child, is elevated
with the passion of pride, by means of the double relation of
impressions and ideas. Since, therefore, the passion depends on these
relations, whatever strengthens any of the relations must also increase
the passion, and whatever weakens the relations must diminish the
passion. Now 'tis certain the identity of the possession strengthens the
relation of ideas arising from blood and kindred, and conveys the fancy
with greater facility from one generation to another, from the remotest
ancestors to their posterity, who are both their heirs and their
descendants. By this facility the impression is transmitted more entire,
and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6:2_7" id="Footnote_6:2_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6:2_7"><span class="label">[6:2]</span></a> A tragic incident occurred in the year 1683, in which
Hume of Ninewells, and Johnston of Hilton, were victims to the
revengeful passions of a brother of the Earl of Home, vented under
circumstances of singular treachery and inhospitality. It is thus
narrated in Law's Memorials, p. 259. "December, 1683, about the close of
that moneth, the Earl himself being from home, the Lairds of Hilton and
Nynhools came to make a visit to the Earl of Home his house, and went to
dice and cards with Mr. William Home, the Earl's brother. Some sharp
words fell amongst them at their game, which were not noticed, as it
seemed to them; yet, when the two gentlemen were gone to their
bed-chambers, the foresaid Mr. William comes up with his sword and stabs
Hilton with nine deadly wounds, in his bed, that he dies immediately;
and wounds Nynhools mortally, so that it was thought he could not live,
and immediately took horse and fled into England&mdash;a treacherous and
villanous act done to two innocent gentlemen, the fruits of dicing and
card gaming."</p>

<p>"Joseph Johnstone of Hilton was stabbed by Mr. William, brother to
Charles earle of Hume. Hilton being of a lofty temper, had given Mr.
Hume bad words in his own house of Hilton, and a box on the ear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
William Hume made his escape to England, on Hilton's horse. He was after
killed himself in the wars abroad."&mdash;Lord Fountainhall's Diary, p. 33.</p>

<p>The editor of Law, Mr. Kirkpatrick Sharpe, appends the following farther
notices of this incident:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before his death he is said to have returned to Scotland, smitten with
remorse, and anxious to obtain pardon of a near male relation of
Johnstone's, then residing in Edinburgh. This gentleman, in the dusk of
the evening, was called forth to the outside stairs of the house, to
speak with a stranger muffled in a cloak. As he proceeded along the
passage, the door being open, he recognised the murderer; and
immediately drawing his sword, rushed towards him, on which the other
leapt nimbly down from the stairs into the street, and was never again
seen in Scotland." These events were made the subject of an amusing
sketch in <cite>Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</cite>, No. 569.</p>

of local matters in France or Spain.</p>

<p>The remarks in the text may probably be considered superfluous, being
applicable to by far the greater portion of literary men&mdash;as those who
have attempted to trace, from the internal evidence of their works, the
birthplaces of authors not commemorated by their contemporaries, can
testify. Thomson, also a borderer, and a poet of rural life, has
scarcely any allusion that bears a distinct reference to the scenery of
his childhood, and celebrates the heroism of almost every land but his
own. In that age, however, to be national in Scotland was to be
provincial in Britain; and unless an author chose to aim at the
restricted reputation of a Ramsay or a Pennecuik, he must carefully shun
allusions to his native country. But the very existence of this, as a
general characteristic, seems to render it worthy of notice in this
instance, which must certainly be held, like Thomson's, a peculiarly
marked illustration of this feature in literary history. Hume had
frequently to record events which had taken place close to his home; and
the whole of the surrounding district was full of traditional lore,
about the wild life of the borderers in the seventeenth century, which
would have afforded valuable materials for his history, and some of his
other works, had he been one of those who derive their knowledge from
men as well as from books. But these volumes will afford ample
opportunity for observing, that he required to place no great restraint
on his pen to keep it free of provincial allusions; and that, even in
his most familiar letters, though he often speaks of the friends of his
youth, he says nothing of the places in which he spent his early days.</p>

Society of Edinburgh, there is a letter from the chevalier, addressed to
"Monsieur de Ramsay, à l'Hôtel de Provence, Rue de Condé, Faubourg St.
Germain," dated 1st September, 1742. The receiver of this letter was
probably the correspondent of Hume, to whom it may have been sent, under
the impression that he was the person connected with the Vindication of
the Duchess of Marlborough, a book now well known to have been put into
shape by Hooke, the historian of Rome. The letter is in English; and it
shows that there are works of genius which the author of "The Travels of
Cyrus" had not taste to appreciate. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have read the first book of 'The History of Joseph Andrews,' but
don't believe I shall be able to finish the first volume. Dull burlesque
is still more insupportable than dull morality. Perhaps my not
understanding the language of low life in an English style is the reason
of my disgust; but I am afraid your Britannic wit is at as low an ebb as
the French. I hope to find some more amusement in my Lady Duchess of
Marlborough's adventures. They say a friend of ours has some hand in
them. I pity his misfortune, if he is obliged to stoop below his fine
genius and talents, to please an old rich dowager, that neither deserves
apology nor praise, and that would be too much honoured for her merit by
an ingenious fine satyr. I long to be in a condition to travel, that I
may see and embrace you, make acquaintance with your amiable young Lord,
and assure you both of the tender zeal, friendship, and attachment with
which I am your most humble and most obedient servant,</p>

<p>In the course of the correspondence which follows, there will be found
several quotations from the Latin classics. Hume's handwriting is so
distinct, that we can seldom have any doubt of the individual letters
written by him. At the same time, as he appears to have always quoted
from memory, there is sometimes a greater difference than even that
exhibited above, between the original and his version of it. I have
thought, that were I to attempt to correct his quotations, I would be
removing valuable data from which the reader may form an estimate of his
mental powers and his education. It will perhaps be allowed, that in
some instances he shows a fertile invention in substituting words for
those which his memory has failed to retain; while in others, as in the
above quotation, the fastidious critics of England will perhaps detect
traces of the more slovenly classical education of Scotland. In his
published works, Hume appears to have anxiously collated his quotations.
But in his letters he seems to have been always more anxious about the
judicious choice of his own expressions, than the accurate transcription
of the words of others. His letters appear to have been carefully
composed. He wrote in constant dread of falling into slovenly
colloquialisms of style, and was not ashamed to leave on his letters the
marks of this anxiety, in corrections and interlineations. This
peculiarity must be admitted to be at variance with the received canon
of the learned world, which excuses mistakes and clumsy expressions in
the vernacular language of a writer, but has no mercy for irregularities
in the use of the dead languages.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_25:1_15" id="Footnote_25:1_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25:1_15"><span class="label">[25:1]</span></a> It may be interesting to compare these extracts with his
method of treating the same subject at a later period of his life. The
following is taken from his Essay on the Feudal and Anglo-Norman
Government and Manners, in the two volumes of his History, first
published in 1762.</p>

<p>"The feudal institutions, by raising the military tenants to a kind of
sovereign dignity, by rendering personal strength and valour requisite,
and by making every knight and baron his own protector and avenger,
begat that martial pride and sense of honour, which, being cultivated
and embellished by the poets and romance writers of the age, ended in
chivalry. The virtuous knight fought not only in his own quarrel, but in
that of the innocent, of the helpless, and, above all, of the fair, whom
he supposed to be for ever under the guardianship of his valiant arm.
The uncourteous knight, who, from his castle, exercised robbery on
travellers, and committed violence on virgins, was the object of his
perpetual indignation; and he put him to death without scruple, or
trial, or appeal, whenever he met with him. The great independence of
men made personal honour and fidelity the chief tie among them, and
rendered it the capital virtue of every true knight, or genuine
professor of chivalry. The solemnities of single combat, as established
by law, banished the notion of every thing unfair or unequal in
rencounters, and maintained an appearance of courtesy between the
combatants till the moment of their engagement. The credulity of the age
grafted on this stock the notions of giants, enchanters, spells, and a
thousand wonders, which still multiplied during the time of the
crusades, when men, returning from so great a distance, used the liberty
of imposing every fiction on their believing audience. These ideas of
chivalry infected the writings, conversations, and behaviour of men
during some ages; and even after they were in a great measure banished
by the revival of learning, they left modern <em>gallantry</em>, and the <em>point
of honour</em>, which still maintain their influence, and are the genuine
offspring of those ancient affectations."</p>

eldest son, and so downwards in the order of age:" pleasant enough

Cheyne's "Natural Method of Curing Diseases of the Body and Mind," 1742,
8vo,&mdash;the only work I am aware of his having published subsequently to
the date of Hume's letter, but I have found in it no trace of a
reference to Hume's case. Cheyne's works are perhaps better known to the
public in general, than any medical books of the same period, and their
curious discursive contents amply repay perusal. Their science is of
course held to be completely superseded, but the unscientific reader
cannot help thinking that there is much sagacious good counsel in his
advice, notwithstanding the eccentric garrulity with which it is
uttered. His account of his own experiences, in experimenting on
himself, is the most interesting department of his medical observations.
He describes every thing with a sort of rude eloquence, infinitely more
pleasing to an ordinary reader than scientific precision; and the
recklessness with which he appears to have submitted his own carcass to
the most violent changes of regimen, inclines one to think that he had
applied towards it the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiat experimentum in compore vili</i>. He tells us
that he was disposed to "corpulence by the whole race of one side" of
his family. In the quotation given above, he represents himself as
having been studious in his youth. He began to practise his profession
in London, of which he says&mdash;"The number of fires, sulphurous and
bituminous; the vast expense of tallow and fœtid oil in candles and
lamps, under and above ground; the clouds of stinking breaths and
perspiration, not to mention the ordure of so many diseased, both
intelligent and unintelligent animals; the crowded churches,
churchyards, and burying places, with putrifying bodies, the sinks,
butcher houses, stables, dunghills, and the necessary stagnation,
fermentation, and mixture of all variety of all kinds of atoms, are more
than sufficient to putrify, poison, and infect the air, for twenty miles
round it." Having come from the fresh air of the country into so hopeful
an atmosphere, he seems to have resolved that his habit of living should
be an equally great contrast to his previous studious abstinence. "Upon
my coming to London, I all of a sudden changed my whole manner of
living. I found the bottle-companions, the younger gentry, and
free-livers, to be the most easy of access, and most quickly susceptible
of friendship and acquaintance,&mdash;nothing being necessary for that
purpose but to be able to eat lustily, and swallow down much liquor; and
being naturally of a large size, a cheerful temper, and tolerable lively
imagination; and having, in my country retirement, laid in store of
ideas and facts,&mdash;by these qualifications I soon became caressed by
them, and grew daily in bulk, and in friendship with these gay gentlemen
and their acquaintances. I was tempted to continue this course, no
doubt, from a liking, as well as to force a trade, which method I had
observed to succeed with some others: and thus constantly dining and
supping in taverns, and in the houses of my acquaintances of taste and
delicacy, my health was in a few years brought into great distress, by
so sudden and violent a change. I grew excessively fat, short-breathed,
lethargic, and listless."</p>

<p>The consequences were "a constant, violent headach, giddiness, lowness,
anxiety, and terror," and he went about "like a malefactor condemned, or
one who expected every moment to be crushed by a ponderous instrument of
death hanging over his head." These evil symptoms prompted him to
abandon suppers and restrict himself to a small quantity of animal food
and of fermented liquors. He very naturally found that on this abrupt
change all his "bouncing, protesting, and undertaking companions"
forsook him, and "dropped off like autumnal leaves," leaving him to
vegetate in temperate dreariness, while they "retired to comfort
themselves with a cheer-up cup," so that he pathetically tells us, "I
was forced to retire into the country quite alone, being reduced to the
state of Cardinal Wolsey, when he said, that if he had served his Maker
as faithfully and warmly as he had his prince, he would not have
forsaken him in that extremity."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to follow out the multitudinous course of remedies
he adopted, commencing with "volatiles, foetids, bitters, chalybeats,
and mineral waters," and how he took twenty grains of "what is called
the prince's powder," and "had certainly perished under the operation,
but for an over-dose of laudanum after it," having thus experienced
something like the good fortune of the man of Thessaly who leaped into a
quickset hedge. Under these circumstances he felt his body "melting away
like a snow-ball in summer." Having tried the Bath waters, he appears to
have somewhat revived, whereupon by increasing his quantity of "animal
food and strong liquors," he was "heated so," that he "apprehended a
hectic." His next change was to a milk diet, in which experiment he was
confirmed by a visit to Dr. Taylor of Croydon, its apostle, whom he
found "at home, at his full quart of cow's milk, which was all his
dinner." He found in consequence of this change, that he "increased in
spirits, strength, appetite and gaiety," until, the old Adam struggling
within him, he "began to find a craving and insufferable longing for
more solid and toothsome food, and for higher and stronger liquors."
Hereupon we have him getting more generous in his diet, but still, as he
counts it, "sober, moderate, and plain," in so far as he "drank not
above a quart or three pints at most of wine any day." Under this
regimen, he says, "I swelled to such an enormous size, that upon my last
weighing I exceeded thirty-two stones." Then came fits of various kinds,
and a dreary period of hypochondria, with recurrences to the low diet
system, and then such startling revulsions from it as the following: "I
resolved to change my half pint of port at dinner, into the same
quantity of Florence. I ate, at the same time, a good deal of more
butter with my vegetables, and plenty of old rich cheese; and likewise
nuts extremely&mdash;I procured from abroad and at home, great plenty of all
kinds, as filberts, walnuts, chestnuts, almonds, &amp;c., eating them in
great quantities after dinner by way of dessert," but in pity to the
digestive sympathies of the reader this subject must be dropped. Dr.
Cheyne is&mdash;not the martyr, but the hero of dyspepsia, and Mrs. Radcliffe
could not have drawn him through a longer series of horrors than his
inventive genius seems to have created for himself.</p>

</div>


<p class="section">We have no account of Hume's sojourn in Bristol, except his own very
brief statement, that "in a few months," he "found that scene totally
unsuitable" to him.<a name="FNanchor_48:1_20" id="FNanchor_48:1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:1_20" class="fnanchor">[48:1]</a> He must have proceeded to France about the
middle of the year 1734, and he thus describes in his "own life," his
motives and intentions. "I went over to France, with a view of
prosecuting my studies in a country retreat; and I there laid that plan
of life, which I have steadily and successfully pursued. I resolved to
make a very rigid frugality supply my <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_49" id="Page_v1_49">[49]</a></span>deficiency of fortune, to
maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as
contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in literature."</p>

<p>His subsequent letters show that he proceeded in the first instance to
Paris, where he remained for a short time. Not long before his arrival
there, some occurrences had taken place which were afterwards
prominently referred to in his philosophical writings. A Jansenist,
distinguished by his sanctity and the wide circle of his charities&mdash;the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Paris</span>, having died, a tomb was erected over his remains in the
cemetery of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">St. Médard</span>. Thither the poor, whom the good man had
succoured in life, repaired to bless his memory and pray for the state
of his soul. But it was discovered that this devotion was speedily
rewarded; for the sick were cured, the blind saw, all manner of miracles
were performed; and the evidence of their genuineness was considered so
satisfactory, that the Jesuits were never able to impugn them&mdash;an
instance which it might be well for every one to recall to mind who is
told of phenomena out of the ordinary course of nature being
authenticated by the testimony of respectable and enlightened people. At
length, this series of miracles became offensive to the
government&mdash;there was no saying how far the matter might proceed. It was
resolved that there should be no more miracles performed at the tomb of
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Paris</span>: the gates of the cemetery were closed, and the miracles
necessarily came to an end. This occurred in the year 1732, just two
years before Hume's visit; and it will easily be imagined that the
references to these wonderful events which he would hear in
conversation, suggested many trains of thought to the young philosopher.
It was not long afterwards, and probably while all this <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_50" id="Page_v1_50">[50]</a></span>was very fresh
in his memory, that the principal theory of his Essay on Miracles was
suggested to him. In that Essay he says:</p>

<p>"Many of the miracles of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Paris</span> were proved immediately by witnesses
before the officialty or bishop's court at Paris, under the eye of
Cardinal Noailles, whose character for integrity and capacity was never
contested even by his enemies.</p>

<p>"His successor in the archbishopric was an enemy to the Jansenists, and
for that reason promoted to the see by the court. Yet twenty-two rectors
or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curés</span> of Paris, with infinite earnestness, press him to examine those
miracles, which they assert to be known to the whole world, and
indisputably certain. But he wisely forbore."</p>

<p>And farther on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No less a man than the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Chatillon</span>, a duke and peer of France, of
the highest rank and family, gives evidence of a miraculous cure,
performed upon a servant of his, who had lived several years in his
house with a visible and palpable infirmity.</p>

<p>"I shall conclude with observing, that no clergy are more celebrated for
strictness of life and manners than the secular clergy of France,
particularly the rectors or curés of Paris, who bear testimony to these
impostures."</p>

<p>An illustration of his notice of what was passing around him in Paris,
occurs in the following passage in his "Natural History of Religion."</p>

<p>"I lodged once at Paris in the same hotel with an ambassador from Tunis,
who, having passed some years at London, was returning home that way.
One day I observed his Moorish excellency diverting himself under the
porch, with surveying the splendid equipages that drove along; when
there chanced to <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_51" id="Page_v1_51">[51]</a></span>pass that way some Capucin friars, who had never seen
a Turk, as he, on his part, though accustomed to the European dresses,
had never seen the grotesque figure of a Capucin: and there is no
expressing the mutual admiration with which they inspired each other.
Had the chaplain of the embassy entered into a dispute with these
Franciscans, their reciprocal surprise had been of the same nature. Thus
all mankind stand staring at one another; and there is no beating it
into their heads, that the turban of the African is not just as good or
as bad a fashion as the cowl of the European.&mdash;'He is a very honest
man,' said the Prince of Sallee, speaking of De Ruyter; 'it is a pity he
were a Christian.'"</p>

<p>After leaving Paris, he resided at Rheims in the province of Champagne,
about eighty miles north-east of the metropolis. Thence he addressed to
his friend Michael Ramsay the following letter, full of observation and
thought.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

to my Lord Stair. I am now arrived at Rheims, which is to be
the place of my abode for some considerable time, and where I
hope both to spend my time happily for the present, and lay up
a stock for the future. It is a large town, containing about
forty thousand inhabitants, and has in it about thirty
families that keep coaches, though, by the appearance of the
houses, you would not think there was one. I am recommended to
two of the best families in town, and particularly to a man,
who <!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_52" id="Page_v1_52">[52]</a></span>they say is one of the most learned in France.<a name="FNanchor_52:1_21" id="FNanchor_52:1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:1_21" class="fnanchor">[52:1]</a> He
is just now in the country, so that I have not yet seen him;
though, if I had seen him, it would be some time <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_53" id="Page_v1_53">[53]</a></span>before I
could contract a friendship with him, not being yet sufficient
master of the language to support a conversation; which is a
great vexation to me, but which I hope in a short time to get
over. As I have little more than this to say about business, I
shall use the freedom to entertain you with any idle thoughts
that come into my head, hoping at least you will excuse them,
if not be pleased with them, because they come from an absent
friend.</p>

<p>"When I parted from Paris, the Chevalier Ramsay gave me as his
advice, to observe carefully, and imitate as much as possible,
the manners of the French. For, says he, though the English,
perhaps, have more of the real politeness of the heart, yet
the French certainly have the better way of expressing it.
This gave me occasion to reflect upon the matter, and in my
humble opinion it is just the contrary: viz., that the French
have more real politeness, and the English the better method
of expressing it. By real politeness I mean softness of
temper, and a sincere inclination to oblige and be
serviceable, which is very conspicuous in this nation, not
only among the high but low; in so much that the porters and
coachmen here are civil, and that, not only to gentlemen, but
likewise among themselves; so that I have not yet seen one
quarrel in France, though they are every where to be met with
in England.<a name="FNanchor_53:1_22" id="FNanchor_53:1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_53:1_22" class="fnanchor">[53:1]</a> By the expressions of politeness, I <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_54" id="Page_v1_54">[54]</a></span>mean
those outward deferences and ceremonies which custom has
invented, to supply the defect of real politeness or kindness,
that is unavoidable towards strangers, or indifferent persons,
even in men of the best dispositions in the world. These
ceremonies ought to be so contrived, as that, though they do
not deceive nor pass for sincere, yet still they please by
their appearance, and lead the mind by its own consent and
knowledge into an agreeable delusion. One may err by running
into either of the two extremes; that of making them too like
truth or too remote from it: though we may observe, that the
first is scarce possible, because whenever any expression or
action becomes customary, it can deceive nobody. Thus, when
the Quakers say, 'your friend,' they are as easily understood,
as another, that says, 'your humble servant.' The French err
in the contrary extreme, that of making their civilities too
remote from truth, <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_55" id="Page_v1_55">[55]</a></span>which is a fault, though they are not
designed to be believed; just as it is a transgression of
rules in a dramatic poet to mix any improbabilities with his
fable, though 'tis certain that, in the representation, the
scenes, lights, company, and a thousand other circumstances,
make it impossible he can ever deceive.</p>

<p>"Another fault I find in the French manners, is that, like
their clothes and furniture, they are too glaring. An English
fine gentleman distinguishes himself from the rest of the
world, by the whole tenor of his conversation, more than by
any particular part of it; so that though you are sensible he
excels, you are at a loss to tell in what, and have no
remarkable civilities and compliments to pitch on as a proof
of his politeness. These he so smooths over, that they pass
for the common actions of life, and never put you to<a name="FNanchor_55:1_23" id="FNanchor_55:1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:1_23" class="fnanchor">[55:1]</a>
trouble of returning thanks for them. The English politeness
is always greatest where it appears least.</p>

<p>"After all, it must be confessed that the little niceties of
French behaviour, though troublesome and impertinent, yet
serve to polish the ordinary kind of people, and prevent
rudeness and brutality. For in the same manner as soldiers are
found to become more courageous in learning to hold their
muskets within half an inch of a place appointed; and your
devotees feel their devotion increase by the observance of
trivial superstitions, as sprinkling, kneeling, crossing, &amp;c.;
so men insensibly soften towards each other in the practice of
these ceremonies. The mind pleases itself by the progress it
makes in such trifles, and while it is so supported, makes an
easy transition to something more material. And I verily
believe it is for this reason that you scarce ever meet with a
clown or an ill-bred man in France.</p>

<p><!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_56" id="Page_v1_56">[56]</a></span>"You may perhaps wonder that I, who have stayed so short time
in France, and who have confessed that I am not master of
their language, should decide so positively of their manner.
But you will please to observe, that it is with nations as
with particular men, where one trifle frequently serves more
to discover the character, than a whole train of considerable
actions. Thus, when I compare our English phrase of 'humble
servant,' which likewise we omit upon the least intimacy, with
the French one of 'the honour of being your most humble
servant,' which they never forget,&mdash;this, compared with other
circumstances, lets me clearly see the different humours of
the nations. This phrase, of the honour of doing or saying
such a thing to you, goes so far, that my washing-woman to-day
told me, that she hoped she would have the honour of serving
me while I staid at Rheims; and what is still more absurd, it
is said by people to those who are very much their inferiors.</p>

<p>"Before I conclude my letter, I must tell you that I hope you
will excuse my rudeness, if I use the freedom (?)<a name="FNanchor_56:1_24" id="FNanchor_56:1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:1_24" class="fnanchor">[56:1]</a> to
desire of you that, the next time you do me the honour of
writing to me, you will be so good as to sit down a day before
the post goes away; for I cannot help being afraid that, in
your haste, you have omitted many things, which otherwise I
would have had the honour and satisfaction of hearing from
you. When you are so good as to condescend to write, please to
direct so:&mdash;'<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A Monsieur&mdash;Monsieur David Hume, gentilhomme,

</div>

<p>Hume states, in his "own life," that he passed <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_57" id="Page_v1_57">[57]</a></span>"three years" very
agreeably in France. We find from a letter to Principal Campbell,<a name="FNanchor_57:1_26" id="FNanchor_57:1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_57:1_26" class="fnanchor">[57:1]</a>
that two of these years were spent at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Flêche</span>, and that he had some
communication with the members of the Jesuits' College there. He says,
"It may perhaps amuse you to learn the first hint, which suggested to me
that argument which you have so strenuously attacked. I was walking in
the cloisters of the Jesuits' College of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Flêche</span>, a town in which I
passed two years of my youth, and engaged in a conversation with a
Jesuit of some parts and learning, who was relating to me, and urging
some nonsensical miracle performed lately in their convent, when I was
tempted to dispute against him; and as my head was full of the topics of
my Treatise of Human Nature, which I was at that time composing, this
argument immediately occurred to me, and I thought it very much
gravelled my companion; but at last he observed to me, that it was
impossible for that argument to have any solidity, because it operated
equally against the Gospel as the Catholic miracles;&mdash;which observation
I thought proper to admit as a sufficient answer. I believe you will
allow, that the freedom at least of this reasoning makes it somewhat
extraordinary to have been the produce of a convent of Jesuits, though
perhaps you may think the sophistry of it savours plainly of the place
of its birth."</p>

<p>This same Jesuits' College of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Flêche</span>, is familiar to the
philosophical reader as the seminary in which Des Cartes was educated.
The place which Hume had just left, has been seen to be associated with
the birth and residence of a distinguished opponent of <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_58" id="Page_v1_58">[58]</a></span>the Cartesian
theory. We now find him perfecting his work in that academic solitude,
where Des Cartes himself was educated, and where he formed his theory of
commencing with the doubt of previous dogmatic opinions, and framing for
himself a new fabric of belief. The coincidence is surely worthy of
reflective association, and it is perhaps not the least striking
instance of Hume's unimaginative nature, that in none of his works,
printed or manuscript, do we find an allusion to the circumstance, that
while framing his own theories, he trod the same pavement that had
upwards of a century earlier borne the weight of one whose fame and
influence on human thought was so much of the same character as he
himself panted to attain.</p>

<p>It is to Hume's early sojourn in France that we must assign the time and
the scene of Mackenzie's pleasant fiction, called the "Story of La
Roche," published in the Mirror of 1779. It is generally admitted that
the writer's materials were merely the character and habits of the
philosopher, and that there was no groundwork for the narrative in any
incident that had actually occurred. But the story must be taken as the
observations of an acute perception, and a finely adjusted taste, upon
Hume's character; and our reliance on the accuracy of the picture is
enhanced by the circumstance that Smith, deceived by its air of reality,
expressed his wonder that Hume had never told him of the incident.<a name="FNanchor_58:1_27" id="FNanchor_58:1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:1_27" class="fnanchor">[58:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_59" id="Page_v1_59">[59]</a></span>The opening description is in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"More than forty years ago, an English philosopher, whose works have
since been read and admired by all Europe, resided at a little town in
France. Some disappointments in his native country had first driven him
abroad, and he was afterwards induced to remain there, from having found
in this retreat, where the connexions even of nature and language were
avoided, a perfect seclusion and retirement, highly favourable to the
development of abstract subjects, in which he excelled all the writers
of his time.</p>

<p>"Perhaps in the structure of such a mind as Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s, the fine and
more delicate sensibilities are seldom known to have place; or, if
originally implanted there, are in a great measure extinguished by the
exertions of intense study and profound investigation. Hence the idea of
philosophy and unfeelingness being united, has become proverbial; and,
in common language, the former word is often used to express the latter.
Our philosopher had been censured by some, as deficient in warmth and
feeling: but the mildness of his manners has been allowed by all; and it
is certain, that if he was not easily melted into compassion, it was at
least not difficult to awaken his benevolence."</p>

<p>The impression of the actions of a kind, charitable, and tolerant
disposition, conveyed by the circumstances of the narrative, cannot be
represented without incorporating it in full; and it will probably be
thought that one or two passing sketches of character, such as the
above, are all that should be taken into a work like the present, from a
book accessible to every reader. Thus, when the housekeeper comes with
the account of the distresses of the poor protestant clergyman and his
daughter:</p>

<p><!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_60" id="Page_v1_60">[60]</a></span>"Her master laid aside the volume in his hand, and broke off the chain
of ideas it had inspired. His night-gown was exchanged for a coat, and
he followed his gouvernante to the sick man's apartment."</p>

<p>Again,&mdash;</p>

<p>"La Roche found a degree of simplicity and gentleness in his companion,
which is not always annexed to the character of a learned or a wise man.
His daughter, who was prepared to be afraid of him, was equally
undeceived. She found in him nothing of that self-importance which
superior parts, or great cultivation of them, is apt to confer. He
talked of every thing but philosophy or religion; he seemed to enjoy
every pleasure and amusement of ordinary life, and to be interested in
the most common topics of discourse: when his knowledge or learning at
any time appeared, it was delivered with the utmost plainness, and
without the least shadow of dogmatism."</p>

<p>And not less distinctly are the following sentences the echo of
Mackenzie's own observations of the character and habits of the
philosopher, that they are put in the varied shape of dialogue and
narrative.</p>

<p>"You regret, my friend," said [La Roche,] "when my daughter and I talk
of the exquisite pleasure derived from music, you regret your want of
musical powers and musical feelings; it is a department of soul, you
say, which nature has almost denied you, which, from the effects you see
it have on others, you are sure must be highly delightful. Why should
not the same thing be said of religion? Trust me, I feel it in the same
way, an energy, an inspiration, which I would not lose for all the
blessings of sense or enjoyments of the world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it would have been
inhuman in our philosopher to have clouded, even with a doubt, the
sunshine of this belief.</p>

<p><!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_61" id="Page_v1_61">[61]</a></span>"His discourse was very remote from metaphysical disquisition or
religious controversy. Of all men I ever knew, his ordinary conversation
was the least tinctured with pedantry or liable to dissertation. With La
Roche and his daughter it was perfectly familiar. The country round
them, the manners of the villagers, the comparison of both with those of
England, remarks on the works of favourite authors, or the sentiments
they conveyed, and the passions they excited, with many other topics in
which there was an equality, or alternate advantage among the speakers,
were the subjects they talked on."</p>

<p>Nor can one, after having quoted so much, avoid giving the concluding
sentence, in which the philosopher contemplates the old clergyman's
grief for the loss of his daughter, and at the same time that he
perceives its bitterness and intensity, is made aware of the
consolations which the bereaved old man finds in religion, and "rejoices
that such consolation" is his.</p>

<p>"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s heart was smitten; and I have heard him long after confess,
that there were moments when the remembrance overcame him even to
weakness; when, amidst all the pleasures of philosophical discovery, and
the pride of literary fame, he recalled to his mind the venerable figure
of the good La Roche, and wished that he had never doubted."</p>

<p>The account of his sojourn in France is thus given in his "own
life:"&mdash;"During my retreat in France, first at Rheims, but chiefly at La
Flêche, in Anjou, I composed my 'Treatise of Human Nature.' After
passing three years very agreeably in that country, I came over to
London in 1737."</p>

<p>We must now follow him to London, where we find him occupied in carrying
his "Treatise of Human Nature," through the press. One of his early
friends <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_62" id="Page_v1_62">[62]</a></span>was his namesake Henry Home, afterwards Lord Kames, who
pursued, but with unequal step, the same path with himself. Home was
fifteen years the elder of the two, and had joined the bar in 1723. He
had already published some of his professional works; but it was at a
subsequent period of his life, and when he perhaps became emulous of the
fame of his friend, that he attempted works in ethics, metaphysics, and
criticism. During many years of continued intimacy, these two
distinguished men enjoyed each other's mutual respect; but, in their
early intercourse, when his senior had for some time occupied a
prominent position in the eye of the public, we naturally find Hume
writing about his great project in a tone of modest deference.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Henry Home</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, December 2, 1737.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am sorry I am not able to satisfy your curiosity
by giving you some general notion of the plan upon which I
proceed. But my opinions are so new, and even some terms I am
obliged to make use of, that I could not propose, by any
abridgment, to give my system an air of likelihood, or so much
as make it intelligible. It is a thing I have in vain
attempted already, at a gentleman's request in this place, who
thought it would help him to comprehend and judge of my
notions, if he saw them all at once before him. I have had a
greater desire of communicating to you the plan of the whole,
that I believe it will not appear in public before the
beginning of next winter. For, besides that it would be
difficult to have it printed before the rising of the
parliament, I must confess I am not ill pleased with a little
delay, that it may appear with as few <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_63" id="Page_v1_63">[63]</a></span>imperfections as
possible. I have been here near three months, always within a
week of agreeing with my printers; and you may imagine I did
not forget the work itself during that time, where I began to
feel some passages weaker for the style and diction than I
could have wished. The nearness and greatness of the event
roused up my attention, and made me more difficult to please,
than when I was alone in perfect tranquillity in France. But
here I must tell you one of my foibles. I have a great
inclination to go down to Scotland this spring to see my
friends; and have your advice concerning my philosophical
discoveries; but cannot overcome a certain shamefacedness I
have to appear among you at my years, without having yet a
settlement, or so much as attempted any. How happens it that
we philosophers cannot as heartily despise the world as it
despises us? I think in my conscience the contempt were as
well founded on our side as on the other.</p>

<p>"Having a franked letter, I was resolved to make use of it;
and accordingly enclose some '<cite>Reasonings concerning
Miracles</cite>,'<a name="FNanchor_63:1_28" id="FNanchor_63:1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_63:1_28" class="fnanchor">[63:1]</a> which I once thought of publishing with the
rest, but which I am afraid will give too much offence, even
as the world is disposed at present. There is something in the
turn of thought, and a good deal in the turn of expression,
which will not perhaps appear so proper, for want of knowing
the context: but the force of the argument you'll be judge of,
as it stands. Tell me your thoughts of it. Is not the style
too diffuse? though, as that was a popular argument, I have
spread it out much more than the other parts of the work. I
beg of you to <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_64" id="Page_v1_64">[64]</a></span>show it to nobody, except to Mr. Hamilton, if
he pleases; and let me know at your leisure that you have
received it, read it, and burnt it. Your thoughts and mine
agree with respect to Dr. Butler, and I would be glad to be
introduced to him. I am at present castrating my work, that
is, cutting off its nobler parts; that is, endeavouring it
shall give as little offence as possible, before which, I
could not pretend to put it into the Doctor's hands. This is a
piece of cowardice, for which I blame myself, though I believe
none of my friends will blame me. But I was resolved not to be
an enthusiast in philosophy, while I was blaming other
enthusiasms. If ever I indulge myself in any, 'twill be when I
tell you that I am, dear Sir, yours."<a name="FNanchor_64:1_29" id="FNanchor_64:1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_64:1_29" class="fnanchor">[64:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Butler, to whom Hume is thus found desiring an introduction, had, in the
immediately preceding year, published "The Analogy of Religion, Natural
and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature;" and it appears
that Hume courted the attention of the author of that clear logical work
to those speculations of his own, which, in the opinion of the world in
general, have so opposite a tendency to that of the "Analogy." The
following letter, acknowledging an introduction from Home, and dated 4th
March, 1738, tells its own tale.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I shall not trouble you with any formal compliments or
thanks, which would be but an ill return for the kindness you
have done me in writing in my behalf, to one you are so little
acquainted with as Dr. Butler; and, I am afraid, stretching
the truth in favour of a friend. I have called upon the
Doctor, <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_65" id="Page_v1_65">[65]</a></span>with a design of delivering him your letter, but find
he is at present in the country. I am a little anxious to have
the Doctor's opinion. My own I dare not trust to; both because
it concerns myself, and because it is so variable, that I know
not how to fix it. Sometimes it elevates me above the clouds;
at other times, it depresses me with doubts and fears; so
that, whatever be my success, I cannot be entirely
disappointed. Somebody has told me that you might perhaps be
in London this spring. I should esteem this a very lucky
event; and notwithstanding all the pleasures of the town, I
would certainly engage you to pass some philosophical evenings
with me, and either correct my judgment, where you differ from
me, or confirm it where we agree. I believe I have some need
of the one, as well as the other; and though the propensity to
diffidence be an error on the better side, yet 'tis an error,
and dangerous as well as disagreeable.&mdash;I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I lodge at present in the Rainbow Coffeehouse, Lancaster
Court."<a name="FNanchor_65:1_30" id="FNanchor_65:1_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_65:1_30" class="fnanchor">[65:1]</a></p>
</div>


<p>The transactions between authors and booksellers are seldom accompanied
by any formidable array of legal formalities; but Hume and his
publishers seem to have thought it necessary to bind each other in the
most stringent manner, to the performance of their respective
obligations, by "articles of agreement, made, concluded, and agreed,
upon the 26th day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand
seven hundred and thirty-eight, and in the twelfth year of the reign of
our sovereign lord King George the Second,&mdash;between David Hume of
Lancaster Court of the one part, and John Noone of Cheapside, <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_66" id="Page_v1_66">[66]</a></span>London,
bookseller, of the other part." By this very precise document, it is
provided, that "the said David Hume shall and will permit and suffer the
said John Noone to have, hold, and enjoy, the sole property, benefit,
and advantage of printing and publishing the first edition of the said
book, not exceeding one thousand copies thereof." The author, in return,
receives £50, and twelve bound copies of the book.<a name="FNanchor_66:1_31" id="FNanchor_66:1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_66:1_31" class="fnanchor">[66:1]</a> The transaction
is on the whole creditable to the discernment and liberality of Mr.
Noone. It may be questioned, whether, in this age, when knowledge has
spread so much wider, and money is so much less valuable, it would be
easy to find a bookseller, who, on the ground of its internal merits,
would give £50 for an edition of a new metaphysical work, by an unknown
and young author, born and brought up in a remote part of the empire.
These articles refer to the first and second of the three volumes of the
"Treatise of Human Nature;" and they were accordingly published in
January, 1739. They include "Book I. Of the Understanding," and "Book
II. Of the Passions."</p>

<p>It has been generally and justly remarked, that the Treatise is among
the least systematic of philosophical works&mdash;that it has neither a
definite and comprehensive plan, nor a logical arrangement. It was,
indeed, so utterly deficient in the former&mdash;there was so complete a want
of any projected scope of subject which the author was bound to exhaust
in what he wrote&mdash;that an attempt to divide and subdivide the matter
after it had been written, according to a logical arrangement, would
only, as a sort of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</i>, have exposed the imperfect
character of the original plan. The author, therefore, <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_67" id="Page_v1_67">[67]</a></span>very discreetly
allowed his matter to be arranged as the subjects of which he treated
had respectively suggested themselves, and bestowed on his work a title
rather general than comprehensive,&mdash;a title, of which all that can be
said of its aptness to the subject is, that no part of his book can be
said to be wholly without it, while he might have included an almost
incalculable multitude of other subjects within it. He called it simply
"A Treatise of Human Nature;" and by a subsidiary title, explanatory
rather of his method than definitive of his matter, he called it "an
attempt to introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral
subjects."</p>

<p>The purely metaphysical,<a name="FNanchor_67:1_32" id="FNanchor_67:1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:1_32" class="fnanchor">[67:1]</a> and, at the same time, the most original
portion of the work, and that which has most conspicuously rendered
itself a constituent part of the literature of intellectual philosophy,
is "Book I. Of the Understanding." "Book II. Of the Passions," contains
mixed metaphysics and ethics, with occasional notices of phenomena,
which, though Hume does not, other writers would be likely to connect
with physiological inquiries. The third book, "Of Virtue and Vice in
General," published a year later, is of an ethical character, being an
inquiry into the origin and proper system of morals, and an application
of the system to government and politics.</p>

<p><!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_68" id="Page_v1_68">[68]</a></span>The "Treatise of Human Nature" afforded materials for the criticism of
two very distinct classes of writers. The one consisted of men imbued
with a spirit of inquiry kindred to that of Hume, and a genius capable
of appreciating his services in the cause of truth; who, as the teachers
of systems of which they were themselves the architects, had to attack
or to defend the principles promulgated in the Treatise, according as
these differed from or corresponded with their own. It is in the
writings of these men that the true immortality of Hume as a philosopher
consists. Whether they find in him great truths to acknowledge, or
subtle and plausible errors to attack, they are the vital evidence of
the originality of his work, of the genius that inspired it, and of its
great influence on human thought and action. The other class of critics
are those who, in pamphlets, or works more ambitious but not rising in
real solidity above that fugitive class, or in occasional digressions
from other topics, have endeavoured to prejudice the minds of their
readers against the principles of the Treatise, by exaggeration, or by
the misapplication of their metaphysical doctrines to the proceedings of
every-day life,&mdash;a set of literary efforts of quick production and as
quick decay.</p>

<p>To the former class of authors, it is of course not within the scope of
the present writer's ambition to belong, and he sees no occasion to
attempt to imitate the latter. In a work, however, which professes to
give a life of David Hume, it is necessary to say something about the
"Treatise of Human Nature;" and as a preliminary to such an attempt, it
may be well to mark the boundaries within which the writer conceives
that the duty he has assumed calls on him for a description of the work,
neither impugning nor defending any of the opinions it sets forth.</p>

<p><!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_69" id="Page_v1_69">[69]</a></span>It seems to be right that some attempt should be made to describe the
character and strength of the author's intellect, and the method of its
operations; and to give a view of the fundamental characteristic
principles by which he professes to distinguish his own philosophy from
that of other writers on metaphysical subjects. An attempt should also
be made to tell in what respect Hume has made incidental suggestions
which have either been admitted as new truths in metaphysics, or have,
as original but perhaps fallacious suggestions, afforded to other
thinkers the means of establishing truths. These being the general
objects to be kept in view, there is no intention to take them in any
precise order, or to exhaust them in remarks on this one work. To
attempt an analysis of the work would be out of place. There can be no
more repulsive matter for reading than condensed metaphysics; and
probably there is nothing less instructive than those abridgments,
which, necessarily suppressing the author's discursive arguments, appeal
almost entirely to the memory. To seize on and give a descriptive rather
than an analytical account of the prominent features of the system, will
be the chief aim of these remarks. Moreover, the Treatise bears on
subjects which are nearly all recalled in its author's subsequent works;
and while there are some things in the critical history of Hume's
opinions which may be appropriately viewed in connexion with his first
publication, there are others which it may be more expedient to examine
when he is found reconsidering the subjects in his later works; and
again, others which may be viewed in a general attempt to describe the
extent of his literary achievements.</p>

<p>The Treatise has been already spoken of as embracing two great objects,
metaphysics and ethics; or three, if <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_70" id="Page_v1_70">[70]</a></span>politics be considered as distinct
from ethics. The great leading principle of the metaphysical department,
and a principle which is never lost sight of in any part of the book,
is, that the materials on which intellect works are the <em>impressions</em>
which represent immediate sensation, whether externally as by the
senses, or internally as by the passions, and <em>ideas</em> which are the
faint reflections of these impressions. Thus to speak colloquially, when
I see a picture, or when I am angry with some one, there is an
<em>impression</em>; but when I think about this picture in its absence, or
call to recollection my subsided anger, what exists in either case is an
<em>idea</em>. Hume looked from words to that which they signified, and he
found that where they signified any thing, it must be found among the
things that either are or have been impressions. The whole varied and
complex system of intellectual machinery he found occupied in the
representation, the combination, or the arrangement of these raw
materials of intellectual matter. If I say I see an object, I give
expression to the fact, that a certain impression is made on the retina
of my eye. If I convey to the person I am speaking to an accurate notion
of what I mean, I awaken in his mind ideas left there by previous
impressions, brought thither by his sense of sight.<a name="FNanchor_70:1_33" id="FNanchor_70:1_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:1_33" class="fnanchor">[70:1]</a> Thus, in the
particular case of the external senses, when they are considered as in
direct communication between the mind and any object, there are
impressions: when the senses are not said <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_71" id="Page_v1_71">[71]</a></span>to be in communication with
the object, the operations of the mind in connexion with it, are from
vestiges which the impressions have left on the mind; and these vestiges
are called ideas, and are always more faint than the original
impressions themselves. And a material circumstance to be kept in view
at the very threshold of the system is, that there is no specific and
distinct line drawn between impressions and ideas. Their difference is
in degree merely&mdash;the former are stronger, the latter weaker. There is
no difference in kind; and there is sometimes doubt whether that which
is supposed to be an impression may not be a vivid idea, and that which
is supposed to be an idea a faint impression.</p>

<p>When Hume examined, with more and more minuteness, the elements of the
materials on which the mind works, he could still find nothing but these
impressions and ideas. Looking at language as a machinery for giving
expression to thought, he thus established for himself a test of its
adaptation to its right use,&mdash;a test for discovering whether in any
given case it really served the purpose of language, or was a mere
unmeaning sound. As he found that there was nothing on which thought
could operate but the impressions received through sensation, or the
ideas left by them, he considered that a word which had not a meaning to
be found in either of these things, had no meaning at all. He looked
upon ideas as the goods with which the mind was stored; and on these
stores, as being of the character of impressions, while they were in the
state of coming into the mind. When any one, then, in reasoning, or any
other kind of literature, spoke of any thing as existing, the principle
of his theory was, that this storehouse of idealized impressions should
be searched for one corresponding to the term made use <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_72" id="Page_v1_72">[72]</a></span>of. If such an
impression were not found, the word was, so far as our human faculties
were concerned, an unmeaning one. Whether there was any existence
corresponding to its meaning, no one could say: all that the sceptical
philosopher could decide was, that, so far as human intellect was put in
possession of materials for thought, it had nothing to warrant it in
saying, that this word represented any thing of which that intellect had
cognizance.</p>

<p>This limitation of the material put at the disposal of the mind, was
largely illustrated in the course of the work; and the illustrations
assumed some such character as this:&mdash;Imaginative writers present us
with descriptions of things which never, within our own experience, have
existed,&mdash;of things which, we believe, never have had existence. Yet,
however fantastic and heterogeneous may be the representations thus
presented to our notice, there is no one part, of which we form a
conception, that is any thing more than a new arrangement of ideas that
have been left in the mind by impressions deposited there by sensation.
The most extravagant of eastern or classical fictions there find their
elements. If it be a three-headed dog, a winged horse, a fiery dragon,
or a golden palace, that is spoken of, the reader who forms a conception
of the narrative puts it together with the ideas left in his mind by
impressions conveyed through the external senses. If a spectre is said
to be raised, it may be spoken of as not denser than the atmosphere, yet
the attributes that bring a conception of it to the intellect are the
form and proportions of a human being,&mdash;expression, action, and
habiliments: all elements the ideas of which the mind has received
through the impressions of the senses. If words were used in a book of
fiction which did not admit of being thus realized by the <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_73" id="Page_v1_73">[73]</a></span>mind putting
together a corresponding portion of the ideas stored up within
it&mdash;supplying, as it were, the described costume from this
wardrobe&mdash;then, according to Hume's philosophy, the word would be a
sound without meaning. He maintained a like rule as to books of
philosophy. If the authors used terms which were not thus represented in
the storehouse of the matter of thought and language, they were not
reasoning on what they knew; they were not using words as the signs of
things signified, but printing unmeaning collections of letters, or
uttering senseless sounds.</p>

<p>The system, if it were to be classed under the old metaphysical
divisions, was one of nominalism. Such words as shape, colour, hardness,
roughness, &amp;c. the author of the Treatise could only admit to have a
meaning in as far as they signified ideas in the mind; and these ideas
could only be there as the relics of impressions derived through the
senses. Thus, general terms, such as the categories of Aristotle, could
have no existence except in so far as they represented and called up
particulars. Of the abstract term colour, our notion is derived solely
from the ideas left in the mind by the actual impressions made through
the senses. Heat, cold, and largeness, so far as these words represent
what is really in the mind, have no other foundation.</p>

<p>The application of this system to the mathematics, and to natural
philosophy, was so startling as to afford to some readers almost a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>. The infinite divisibility of matter was
arraigned by Hume as so far from being a truth, that it was not even
capable of being conceived by the mind, which had never yet received any
impressions through the senses corresponding to the expression. Every
man had seen matter divided&mdash;some into smaller fragments <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_74" id="Page_v1_74">[74]</a></span>than others;
but where our ideas, derived from actual experiment, stopped in
minuteness of division, the conception of divisibility stopped also. The
truth of geometrical demonstration, as applicable to practice, he did
not deny; but he maintained, or rather seemed to maintain, for his
reasoning here is of a highly subtle order, that we have a conception of
these operations only in as far as they concur with really existing
things, or, more properly speaking, with the ideas in the mind conveyed
thither by the senses. Of the point, which has no breadth, depth, or
length; of the straight line, which is deficient in the first and
second, and not in the last of these qualities, he denied that we could
have an idea, unless that idea were just as much the representative of
an actual existence as any other idea is.</p>

<p>Infinity of space was an expression to which he had an objection on
similar grounds; it had no idea corresponding to it lodged in the mind.
Of space finite in various quantities, the mind possessed ideas stored
up from repeated impressions, and by adding these ideas together, more
or less vastness in the conception of finite space was afforded. But any
thing beyond this definitive increase, attested as it was by the senses,
the mind had no means of conceiving. Whatever might be in another
intellectual world, there was no idea corresponding to infinity of space
in the mind of man. It thence followed, that space unoccupied was a
conception of which the mind was incapable, because the impressions
originally conveyed to the mind were the medium through which the
conception of space existed, and where there were no ideas of such
impressions, an aggregate idea of space was wanting. In the same manner
it was held, that it was in a succession of impressions, with ideas
corresponding, that <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_75" id="Page_v1_75">[75]</a></span>the conception of time consisted, and that without
such a succession, time would be a thing unknown and unconceived. Our
ideas of numbers he found to be but the collected ideas of the
impressions of the units of which the senses have received distinct
impressions; and in confirmation of this he appealed to the distinctness
of our notion of small numbers, which our mind has been accustomed to
find represented by units, and our imperfect conception of those large
numbers, which we have never had presented to us in detail. How readily
we have a notion of six, but how imperfectly the mind receives the
conception of six millions; how clearly we perceive, in units, the
difference between six and twelve, but how imperfect is our notion of
the difference between six millions and twelve millions.<a name="FNanchor_75:1_34" id="FNanchor_75:1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_75:1_34" class="fnanchor">[75:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_76" id="Page_v1_76">[76]</a></span>All human consciousness being of these two materials, impressions and
ideas, the answer to the question, What knowledge have we of an external
world, resolved itself into this, that there were certain impressions
and ideas which we supposed to relate to it&mdash;further we knew not. When
we turn, according to this theory, from the external world, and, looking
into ourselves, ask what certainty we have of separate self-existence,
we find but a string of impressions and ideas, and we have no means of
linking these together into any notion of a continuous existence. Such
is that boasted thing the human intellect, when its elements are
searched out by a rigid application of the sceptical philosophy of Hume.
Not a thing separate and self-existent, which was, and is, and shall
continue; but a succession of mere separate entities, called in one view
impressions, in another ideas.<a name="FNanchor_76:1_35" id="FNanchor_76:1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_76:1_35" class="fnanchor">[76:1]</a></p>

<p>It may make this brief sketch more clear, to notice a circumstance in
the history of philosophy, which, perhaps, serves better in an
incidental manner to mark the boundaries of the field of Hume's inquiry,
than many pages of discursive description. The transcendentalists took
him up as having examined the materials solely, on which pure reason
operates; <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_77" id="Page_v1_77">[77]</a></span>not pure reason itself. They said that he had examined the
classes of matter which come before the judge, but had omitted to
describe the judge himself, the extent of his jurisdiction, and his
method of enforcing it. They maintained, that all these things, which
with Hume appeared to be the constituent elements of philosophy, were
nothing but the materials on which philosophy works,&mdash;that to presume
them to be of service presupposed a reason which could make use of
them,&mdash;that Hume himself, while thus speculating and telling us that his
mind consisted but of a string of ideas, left behind by certain
impressions, was himself making use of that pure reason which was in him
before the ideas or impressions existed, and was through that power
adapting the impressions and ideas to use. He characterized his system
as "an attempt to introduce the experimental method of reasoning into
moral subjects:" but they said that there was another and a preliminary
matter of inquiry&mdash;the faculty, to speak popularly, which suggested what
experiments should be made, and judged of their results.</p>

<p>Hume may be found indirectly lamenting the fate of his own work on
metaphysics, in his remarks on other works of a kindred character; and
in these criticisms we have a clue to the expectations he had formed. In
his well-known rapid criticism on the literature of the epoch of the
civil wars, he says of Hobbes: "No author in that age was more
celebrated both abroad and at home than Hobbes. In our times, he is much
neglected: a lively instance how precarious all reputations founded on
reasoning and philosophy! A pleasant comedy which paints the manners of
the age, and exposes a faithful picture of nature, is a durable work,
and is transmitted to the latest posterity. But a system, whether
physical or metaphysical, owes commonly its <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_78" id="Page_v1_78">[78]</a></span>success to its novelty; and
is no sooner canvassed with impartiality, than its weakness is
discovered."</p>

<p>Like the majority of literary prophecies dictated by feeling and not by
impartial criticism, this one, whether as it refers to "The Leviathan,"
of which it is ostensibly uttered, or to the "Treatise of Human Nature,"
the fate of which doubtless suggested it, has proved untrue. The
influence of Hobbes has revived, as that of the Treatise remained
undiminished from the time when it was first fully appreciated. And in
both cases their influence has arisen from that element which seems
alone to be capable of giving permanent value to metaphysical thought.
It is not that in either case the fundamental theory of the author is
adopted, as the disciples of old imbibed the system of their masters,
but that each has started some novelties in thought, and, either by
themselves sweeping away prevailing fallacies, or suggesting to others
the means of doing so, have cleared the path of philosophy. As a general
system, the philosophy of Hobbes has been perhaps most completely
rejected at those times when its incidental discoveries and suggestions
made it most serviceable to philosophy, and were the cause of its being
most highly esteemed. "Harm I can do none," says Hobbes, when speaking
of the metaphysicians who preceded him, "though I err not less than
they, for I leave men but as they are, in doubt and dispute." There is
indeed nothing in the later history of metaphysical writing to show that
the triumphs in that department of thought are to stretch beyond the
establishment of incidental truths, the removal of fallacies, and the
suggestion of theories that may teach men to think. The field is a
republic: incidental merit has its praise, and is allowed its
pre-eminence; but no one mind, it may safely be pronounced, holds <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_79" id="Page_v1_79">[79]</a></span>in it
that monarchical sway which Adam Smith retains over the empire of
political economy. The ancient systems anterior to Christianity allowed
of such empire. The pupil did not follow his master merely in this and
that incidental truth developed, but adopted the system in all its
details and proportions as his system and his creed. In later times it
would probably be found that the most devoted admirers of great writers
on metaphysics do not adopt their opinions in the mass; and it seems
that men must now go elsewhere than to the produce of human reason, for
the grand leading principles of the philosophy of belief and disbelief.</p>

<p>To those who hold that the writings of the great metaphysicians are thus
to be esteemed on account, not of their fundamental principles, but of
the truths they bring out in detail, a new theory is like a new road
through an unfrequented country, valuable, not for itself, but for the
scenery which it opens up to the traveller's eye. The thinker who adopts
this view, often wonders at the small beginnings of philosophical
systems&mdash;wonders, perhaps, at the circumstance of Kant having believed
that his own system started into life at one moment as he was reading
Hume's views of Cause and Effect. But the solution is ready at hand. We
feel that the philosopher of Königsberg had in his mind the impulses
that would have driven him into a new path had no Hume preceded him. We
owe it to the Essay on Cause and Effect that it was the starting-point
at which he left the beaten track; but, had it not attracted his
attention, his path would have been as original, though not, perhaps, in
the same direction. And so of Hume himself. If the main outline of his
theory had never occurred to him, he would still have been a great
philosopher; for in some form or other he would have <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_80" id="Page_v1_80">[80]</a></span>found his way to
those incidental and subsidiary discoveries, which are admitted to have
reality in them by many who repudiate his general theory.</p>

<p>Of all the secondary applications of the leading principle of the
Treatise, none has perhaps exercised so extensive an influence on
philosophy, as this same doctrine of cause and effect. Looking to those
separate phenomena, of which in common language we call the one the
cause of the other, and the other the effect of that cause, he could see
no other connexion between them than that the latter immediately
followed the former. He found that the mind, proceeding on the inductive
system, when it repeatedly saw two phenomena thus conjoined, expected,
when that which had been in use to precede the other made its
appearance, that the other would follow; and he found that by repeated
experiment this expectation might be so far strengthened, that people
were ready to stake their most important temporal interests on the
occurrence of the phenomenon called the effect, when that called the
cause had taken place. But if there were any thing else but this
conjunction, of which a knowledge was demanded&mdash;if the unsatisfied
investigator sought for some power in the one phenomenon which enabled
it to be the fabricator of the other&mdash;the sceptical reasoner would
answer, that for all he could say to the contrary such a thing might be,
but he had no clue to that knowledge&mdash;no impression of any such quality
passed into his intellect through sensation&mdash;his mind had no material
committed to it by which the existence or non-existence of any such
thing could be argued.</p>

<p>The vulgar notion of this theory was, that it destroyed all our notions
of regularity and system in the order of nature; that it made no
provision for <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_81" id="Page_v1_81">[81]</a></span>unseen causes, and contemplated only the application of
the doctrines of cause and effect to things which were palpably seen
following each other. But the inventor of the theory never questioned
the regularity of the operations of nature as established by the
inductive philosophy; he only endeavoured to show how far and within
what limits we could acquire a cognizance of the machinery of that
regularity. He denied not that when the spark was applied, the gunpowder
would ignite, or that when the ball was dropped, it would proceed to the
earth with the accelerated motion of gravitation; but he denied that we
could see any other connexion between the cause and effect in either
case, than that of uniform sequence. When it was scientifically adopted,
the theory was found to be productive of the most important results. The
view that when any effect was observed, that phenomenon which was most
uniform in its precedence was the one entitled to be termed the cause,
was a salutary incentive to close and patient investigation, by laying
before the philosopher the simple, numerical question&mdash;what was that
phenomenon which, by the uniformity of its precedence, was entitled to
be termed the cause?<a name="FNanchor_81:1_36" id="FNanchor_81:1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_81:1_36" class="fnanchor">[81:1]</a> The test became of the simplest kind; and, if
the experimentalist had at a particular time considered some phenomenon
as a cause,&mdash;if the farther progress of patient and unprejudiced inquiry
showed that <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_82" id="Page_v1_82">[82]</a></span>another, by the occurrence of instances in which it
preceded the effect while the former did not, had a preferable title to
be termed the cause, the mind in its unbiassed estimate of numbers at
once admitted the claim. But when, according to the antagonist
system,<a name="FNanchor_82:1_37" id="FNanchor_82:1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_82:1_37" class="fnanchor">[82:1]</a> it became settled that any given phenomenon had in it the
power of bringing into existence another, that power was viewed as a
quality of the object. When things are admitted to have qualities, it is
not easy for the mind at once to assent to their non-existence and to
admit that others have the proper title to these qualities. Analogy, the
great source of fallacies, comes to increase the difficulty, by a
confusion of what are termed the qualities of bodies, and those
endowments with which we invest our fellow-creatures. In this respect
Hume's theory of cause and effect has been of great service to inductive
philosophy.</p>

<p>It was an objection to it that it made no allowance for unseen causes;
but it was part of its author's system, that the uniformity which our
observation teaches us, proceeds unseen in those cases to which our
observation cannot penetrate. It was part of the theory, that where
there is a want of the absolute uniformity in the sequence of two
phenomena, they are not respectively cause and effect. This principle is
of vital importance in physical science. It is a notion with the vulgar,
and one that sometimes perhaps lurks unseen in scientific operations,
that the cause sometimes does not produce its effect by reason of some
failure in the operating power. It is from a vague amplification of this
heresy, that the popular <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_83" id="Page_v1_83">[83]</a></span>notion of chance is derived. Hume's theory
nips the bud of such a fallacy by denying, whenever there is a break in
the sequence, that the phenomena which have in other instances followed
each other, really are cause and effect. It is perhaps in the
unscientific application of therapeutics, that the popular fallacy is
most widely and most dangerously exemplified. The whole of the
complexity of that wondrous science consists in the immediate causes and
effects being unseen&mdash;in the phenomena immediately conjoined not being
ascertained, but in attempts being made to estimate them through the
connexion between those external causes to which the internal causes may
have had the relation of effects, and those external effects of which
these internal effects may have been the causes. The character of unseen
causes was aptly illustrated by Hume himself, from the throwing of a
die. The vulgar mind can see no cause and effect in the operation,
because there is a series of causes and effects, which are hidden from
the sight, in the interior of the box; but the philosopher knows not the
less, that those laws of motion, which induction has established to him
as truths, are taking place; and that there is no turn made by the die,
which is not as much the effect of some cause, as the turning of the
hands of a watch, or the parallel motion in a steam engine.</p>

<p>It is one of the peculiar features of the history of mental philosophy,
that there is scarcely ever a new principle, associated with the name of
a great author, but it is shown that it has been anticipated, in some
oracular sentence, probably by an obscure writer. Joseph Glanvill is
pretty well known as the author of "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saducismus Triumphatus</span>," a
vindication of the belief in witches and apparitions, which must have
been perused by all the curious in this species of lore. <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_84" id="Page_v1_84">[84]</a></span>Glanvill was
the author of various tracts on biblical subjects, but it was not
generally known that he wrote a book on sceptical philosophy, called
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scepsis Scientifica</span>, or, Confest Ignorance the Way to Science," until
it was unearthed by the persevering inquiries of Mr. Hallam. In that
book there is the passage, "all knowledge of causes is <em>deductive</em>, for
we know none by simple intuition, but through the medium of their
effects; so that we cannot conclude any thing to be the cause of another
but from its continual accompanying it, for the causality itself is
<em>insensible</em>."<a name="FNanchor_84:1_38" id="FNanchor_84:1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_84:1_38" class="fnanchor">[84:1]</a> This is an addition <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_85" id="Page_v1_85">[85]</a></span>to the many instances where
writers have almost, as it were by chance, laid down principles, of
which <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_86" id="Page_v1_86">[86]</a></span>they show, by neglecting to follow them to their legitimate
conclusions, that they have not understood their full meaning; if it do
not rather illustrate the view already noticed, that in metaphysics our
assent is secured, not to general propositions as such, but to their
particular applications; and that it is not in the laying down of first
principles that important truths are exhibited to the world, but in
those subsidiary expositions by which the discoverer endeavours to show
their application.</p>

<p>The subsequent history of Hume's theory of Cause and Effect, is a marked
illustration of the danger of bringing forward as an argument against
theories purely metaphysical, the statement that they are dangerous to
religion. It is difficult to see where there is a difference between
adducing that argument in the sphere of natural philosophy, from which
it has been long scouted by common consent, and bringing it forward as
an answer to the theories of the metaphysician. In either case it is a
threat, which, in the days of Galileo, bore the terror of corporal
punishment, and in the present day carries the threat of unpopularity,
to the person against whom it is used.<a name="FNanchor_86:1_39" id="FNanchor_86:1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_86:1_39" class="fnanchor">[86:1]</a> If any one should <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_87" id="Page_v1_87">[87]</a></span>suppose
that he finds lurking in the speculations of some metaphysical writer,
opinions from which it may be inferred that he is not possessed of the
hopes and consolations of the Christian, humanity to the unhappy author
should suggest that he ought rather to be pitied than condemned, and
respect for the religious feelings of others should teach that there is
no occasion to endeavour, by a laborious pleading, to demonstrate that a
man who has said nothing against religion is in reality an enemy to
Christianity. They are surely no enlightened friends to religion, who
maintain that the suppression of inquiry as to the material or the
immaterial world, is favourable to the cause of revealed truth. The
blasphemer who raises his voice offensively and contentiously against
what his fellow citizens hold sacred, invokes the public wrath, and is
no just object of sympathy. The extent of his punishment is regretted
only when, by its vindictive excess, it is liable to excite retaliatory
attacks from the same quarter. But the speculative philosopher, who does
not directly interfere with the religion of his neighbours, should be
left to the peaceful pursuit of his inquiries; and those who, instead of
meeting him by fair argument, cry out irreligion, and call in the mob to
their aid, should reflect first, whether it is absolutely certain that
they are right in their conclusion, that his inquiries, if carried out,
would be inimical to religion&mdash;whether some mind more acute and
philosophical than their own, may not either finally confute the
sceptical philosopher's argument, or prove <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_88" id="Page_v1_88">[88]</a></span>that it is not inimical to
religion; and secondly, whether they are not likely to be themselves the
greatest foes to religion, by holding that it requires such defence, and
the practical blasphemers, by proclaiming that religion is in danger?</p>

<p>Kant, the most illustrious opponent of Hume, in allusion to those who
have appealed against him to our religious feelings, asks, what the man
is doing that we should meddle with him; says he is but trying the
strength of human reason, and bids us leave him to combat with those who
are giving him specimens of the fabric on which to try his skill&mdash;tells
us to wait and see who will produce one too strong to be broken to
pieces&mdash;and not cry treason, and appeal to the angry multitude, who are
strangers to these refined reasonings, to rush in. Shall we ask reason
to give us lights, and prescribe beforehand what they are to show
us?<a name="FNanchor_88:1_41" id="FNanchor_88:1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_88:1_41" class="fnanchor">[88:1]</a> "The observation of human blindness and weakness," says Hume
himself, "is the result of all philosophy, and meets us at every turn,
in spite of our endeavours to elude or avoid it." A solemn saying, and
characteristic of one who has done more than any other man to show the
feebleness of poor human reason, and to teach man that he is not all
sufficient to himself.</p>

<p>Those revelations in astronomy and geology, the first glimmerings of
which made the timid if not doubting friends of their cause tremble,
have enlarged year by year in rapid progression; but revealed religion
is not less firm on her throne; and many of those who held that Hume's
theory of Cause and Effect was inimical to revelation, lived to see how
startlingly that argument could be turned against themselves. It has
been well observed by Dugald <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_89" id="Page_v1_89">[89]</a></span>Stewart, that this theory is the most
effectual confutation of the gloomy materialism of Spinoza, "as it lays
the axe to the very root from which Spinozism springs." "The cardinal
principle," he says, "on which the whole of that system turns is, that
all events, physical and moral, are <em>necessarily</em> linked together as
causes and effects; from which principle all the most alarming
conclusions adopted by Spinoza follow as unavoidable and manifest
corollaries. But if it be true, as Mr. Hume contends, and as most
philosophers now admit, that physical causes and effects are known to us
merely as <em>antecedents</em> and <em>consequents</em>; still more if it be true that
the word <em>necessity</em>, as employed in this discussion, is altogether
unmeaning and insignificant, the whole system of Spinoza is nothing
better than a rope of sand, and the very proposition which it professes
to demonstrate is incomprehensible by our faculties."<a name="FNanchor_89:1_42" id="FNanchor_89:1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_89:1_42" class="fnanchor">[89:1]</a></p>

<p>It will be remembered how signally, in the question in the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, as to Sir John Leslie's
professorship, the argument of irreligion was retaliated; and it was
shown that, in the theory of an existing machinery in nature enabling
the universe to proceed in its regular course, the cause having within
it the adequate power for producing its effect, the omnipresence of a
Deity was dispensed with, and there was substituted for the
all-pervading influence of a superior wisdom, a mere material machine,
having within itself the elements of its own regular motion. Thus, in
instances where writers have claimed credit for having aided the cause
of religion by carrying out the principles of natural theology, this
merit has in many cases, and among certain classes of devout religious
thinkers, <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_90" id="Page_v1_90">[90]</a></span>been sternly denied them; and it has been said that their
labours are rather adverse than favourable to revealed religion,
because, through their tendency to make people believe in an established
order in nature, by which causes produce their effects according to a
fixed system, they have the effect of making mankind forget the
existence of a revealed, omnipresent Deity, whose all-competent
superintendence regulates the world, and they supply a religion
independent of the religion of revelation.</p>

<p>Perhaps in this little history we may find an illustration of the view,
that the greatest service which the Treatise has done to philosophy is
that purely incidental one of teaching human reason its own weakness&mdash;of
showing how easily the noblest fabric of human thought may be
undermined, by a destroying agency of power not greater than that of the
constructive genius which has raised it. In this respect it has done to
philosophy the invaluable service of teaching philosophers their own
fallibility. In all the departments of thought, and not only in the
world of thought but in that of action, the spirit of human
infallibility is the greatest obstacle to truth and goodness. Whether it
appear to protect a system which the thinker has framed for himself, or
assume the more modest shape of maintaining, that among conflicting
systems he has made choice of that which is absolutely and certainly
right, while all others which in any way differ from it are as
absolutely and certainly wrong; this offspring of the pride of human
intellect is an equally dangerous enemy of human improvement; and to
have contributed to its downfal is of itself no small achievement for
one mind.</p>

<p>Such are a few remarks on the matter of the first <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_91" id="Page_v1_91">[91]</a></span>part of the "Treatise
of Human Nature"&mdash;given not by any means as an analysis of the doctrines
there taught, but merely as an attempt to characterize them by their
prominent features. It will naturally be expected that a similar attempt
should be made to characterize the form in which these doctrines were
promulgated. As to the style of the Treatise, it possesses the
clearness, flexibility, and simplicity that distinguish the maturity of
its author's literary career, though not quite in all the perfection in
which they afterwards attended his pen. There are occasional
Scoticisms&mdash;a defect which he took infinite pains to cure, but of which
he was never entirely rid. He uses a few obsolete and now harsh sounding
forms of expression, from which he afterwards abstained: such as the
elliptical combination 'tis, for it is. Here, and in the first editions
of his History, he frequently neglects the increment on the perfect
tense, as by saying, "I have forgot," instead of, I have forgotten; "I
have wrote," instead of I have written.</p>

<p>The Treatise has that happy equality of flight, which distinguishes the
author's maturer productions. There is no attempt to soar, and none of
those ambitious inequalities which often deform the works of young
authors. His imagination and language seem indeed to have been kept
permanently chained down by the character of his inquiries. His constant
aim is to make his meaning clear; and in the subtleties of a new and
intricate system of metaphysics, he seems to have felt that there lay
upon him so heavy a responsibility to make use on all occasions of the
clearest and simplest words, that any flight of imagination or eloquence
would be a dangerous experiment.</p>

<p>There is a corresponding absence of pedantic ornament. A young writer
who has read much, is <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_92" id="Page_v1_92">[92]</a></span>generally more anxious to show his learning and
information than his own power of thought. With many the defect lasts
through maturer years, and they write as if to find a good thing in some
unknown author, were more meritorious than to have invented it.
Montesquieu, whom Hume has been accused of imitating, carried this
defect to a vice, and often distorted the order of his reasoning, that
he might introduce an allusion to something discovered in the course of
his peculiar learning. That Hume had read much in philosophy before he
undertook his great work, cannot be doubted, but he does not drag his
readers through the minutiæ of his studies, and is content with giving
them results. In many respects, indeed, one would have desired to know
more of his appreciation of his predecessors. The name of Aristotle is,
it is believed, not once mentioned in the work, and there are only some
indirect allusions to him, and these not very respectful, in casual
remarks on the opinions of the Peripatetics. One would have expected
from Hume a kindred sympathy with the great master of intellectual
philosophy, and a respectful appreciation of one whose inquiries were
conducted with a like acute severity, but whose mind took so much more
wide and comprehensive a grasp of the sources of human knowledge.</p>

<p>It has been often observed, that a person so original in his opinions as
Hume, ought to have made a new nomenclature for the new things which he
taught. But he has no philosophical nomenclature; he appears indeed to
have despised that useful instrument of method, and means of
communicating clear ideas to learners. This want has prevented his
system from being clearly and fully learned by the student, while it has
at the same time probably made his works less repulsive to the <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_93" id="Page_v1_93">[93]</a></span>general
reader. He seems indeed hardly to have been conscious of the advantage
to all philosophy, of uniformity of expression. Using the words "force,"
"vivacity," "solidity," "firmness," and "steadiness," all with the same
meaning, he speaks of this usage as a "variety of terms which may seem
so unphilosophical;" and then observes, more in the style of one who is
tired of philosophical precision than of a philosopher, "Provided we
agree about the thing, 'tis needless to dispute about the terms."</p>

<p>This is a kindred defect to that absence of method which has been
already taken notice of. A fixed nomenclature is a beacon against
repetition and discursiveness. But the Treatise has no pretension to be
a work of which he who omits paying attention to any part, thereby drops
a link in a chain, the loss of which will make the whole appear broken
and inconsistent. There are, it is true, places where the essential
parts of the author's philosophy are developed, the omission of which
would render that which follows hard to be understood, but in general
each department of the work is intelligible in itself. Its author
appears to have composed it in separate fragments; holding in view,
while he was writing each part, the general principle of his theory, but
not taking it for granted that the reader is so far master of that
principle, as not to require it to be generally explained in connexion
with the particular matter under consideration. He seems indeed rather
desirous to dwell on it, as something that the reader may have seen in
the earlier part of the work, but may have neglected to keep in his mind
while he reads the other parts. Perhaps the true model of every
philosophical work is to be found in the usual systems of geometry,
where, whatever is once proposed and proved, is held a <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_94" id="Page_v1_94">[94]</a></span>fixed part of
knowledge, and is never repeated; but as far as psychological reasoning
is from the certainty of geometrical, so distant perhaps, will ever be
the precision of its method from that of geometry.</p>

<p>It may safely be pronounced, that no book of its age presents itself to
us at this day, more completely free from exploded opinions in the
physical sciences. With the exception perhaps of occasional allusions to
"animal spirits," as a moving influence in the human body, the author's
careful sifting sceptical mind seems, without having practically tested
them, to have turned away from whatever doctrines were afterwards
destined to fall before the test of experiment and induction. It was not
that he was so much of a natural philosopher himself as to be able to
test their truth or falsehood, but that with a wholesome jealousy,
characteristic of the mind in which the Disquisition on Miracles was
working itself into shape, he avoided them as things neither coming
within the scope of his own analysis, nor bearing the marks of having
been satisfactorily established by those whose more peculiar province it
was to investigate their claims to be believed. At a later date, his
friend D'Alembert admitted judicial astrology and alchemy as branches of
natural philosophy in his "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Systême Figuré des Connoissances Humaines</span>."
Cudworth, and even the scrutinizing Locke, dealt gravely with matters
doomed afterwards to be ranked among popular superstitions, and Sir
Thomas Browne, in some respects a sceptic, eloquently defended more
"vulgar errors" than he exposed. Hobbes was, in the midst of the darkest
scepticism, a practical believer in the actual presence of the spirits
of the air; and Johnson, whose name, however, it may scarcely be fair to
class in this list, as he did not profess, except for conversational
triumph, to be a reducer <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_95" id="Page_v1_95">[95]</a></span>and demolisher of unfounded beliefs, along
with his partial admission of the existence of spectres, has left behind
him many dogmatic announcements of physical doctrines, which the
progress of science has now long buried under its newer systems.</p>

<p>It is by no means maintained that Hume was beyond his age&mdash;or even on a
par with its scientific ornaments, in physical knowledge; but merely
that he showed a judicious caution in distinguishing, in his published
work, those parts of physical philosophy which had been admitted within
the bounds of true and permanent science, from those which were still in
a state of mere hypothesis. His knowledge of physical science was
probably not very extensive. A small portion of a collection of his
notes on subjects that attracted his attention bear on this subject. The
collection from which they are taken will be noticed in the next
chapter; but as those which are set apart from the others, and are
headed "Natural Philosophy," seem to have been written at an earlier
period than the rest of the collection, and are appropriate to the
present subject, they are here given. It is not expected that they will
awaken in the natural philosopher any great respect for the extent of
Hume's inquiries in this department of knowledge.</p>

</div>


<p>The system of philosophy to which the foregoing remarks apply, was
published when its author was twenty-six years old, and he completed it
in voluntary exile, and in that isolation from the counsel and sympathy
of early friends, which is implied by a residence in an obscure spot in
a foreign country. While he was framing his metaphysical theory, Hume
appears to have permitted no confidential adviser to have access to the
workings of his inventive genius; and as little did he take for granted
any of the reasonings and opinions of the illustrious dead, as seek
counsel of the living. Nowhere is there a work of genius more completely
authenticated, as the produce of the solitary labour of one mind; and
when we reflect on the boldness and greatness of the undertaking, we
have a <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_97" id="Page_v1_97">[97]</a></span>picture of self-reliance calculated to inspire both awe and
respect. The system seems to be characteristic of a lonely mind&mdash;of one
which, though it had no enmity with its fellows, had yet little sympathy
with them. It has few of the features that characterize a partaker in
the ordinary hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows, of humanity; little
to give impulse to the excitement of the enthusiast; nothing to dry the
tear of the mourner. It exposes to poor human reason her own weakness
and nakedness, and supplies her with no extrinsic support or protection.
Such a work, coming from a man at the time of life when our sympathies
with the world are strongest, and our anticipations brightest, would
seem to indicate a mind rendered callous by hardship and disappointment.
But it was not so with Hume. His coldness and isolation were in his
theories alone; as a man he was frank, warm, and friendly. But the same
impulses which gave him resolution to adopt so bold a step, seem at the
same time to have armed him with a hard contempt for the opinions of the
rest of mankind. Hence, though his philosophy is sceptical, his manner
is frequently dogmatical, even to intolerance; and while illustrating
the feebleness of all human reasoning, he seems as if he felt an innate
infallibility in his own. He afterwards regretted this peculiarity; and
in a letter, written apparently at an advanced period of life, we find
him deprecating not only the tone of the Inquiry, but many of its
opinions. He says:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Allow me to tell you, that I never asserted so absurd a
proposition as <em>that any thing might arise without a cause</em>. I
only maintained that our certainty of the falsehood of that
proposition proceeded neither from intuition nor
demonstration, but from another <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_98" id="Page_v1_98">[98]</a></span>source. <em>That Cæsar existed</em>,
that there is such an island as Sicily,&mdash;for these
propositions, I affirm, we have no demonstration nor intuitive
proof,&mdash;would you infer that I deny their <em>truth</em>, or even
their certainty? There are many different kinds of certainty;
and some of them as satisfactory to the mind, though perhaps
not so regular as the demonstrative kind.</p>

in argument, I shall acknowledge (what is infinitely more
material) a very great mistake in conduct, viz. my publishing
at all the 'Treatise of Human Nature,' a book which pretended
to innovate in all the sublimest paths of philosophy, and
which I composed before I was five-and-twenty; above all, the
positive air which prevails in that book, and which may be
imputed to the ardour of youth, so much displeases me, that I
have not patience to review it. But what success the same
doctrines, better illustrated and expressed, may meet with,

<p><!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_99" id="Page_v1_99">[99]</a></span>The reader, who passes from the first book of the Treatise, on "the
Understanding," to the second, on "the Passions," will, in many
instances, feel like one who is awakened from a dream, or as if, after
penetrating in solitude and darkness into the unseen world of thought,
he had come forth to the cheerful company of mankind, and were holding
converse with a shrewd and penetrating observer of the passing world. As
Hume was never totally insensible to the elements of social enjoyment,
but had indeed an ample sympathy with the joys and sorrows of his fellow
men, he appears occasionally, in the midst of his most subtle
speculations, to experience a desire to burst from the dark prison of
solitude, into which he had voluntarily immured himself, and bask in the
sunshine of the world. "Man," he says, in his Treatise, "is the creature
of the universe who has the most ardent desire of society, and is fitted
for it by the most advantages. We can form no wish which has not a
reference to society. A perfect solitude is, perhaps, the greatest
punishment we can suffer. Every pleasure languishes when enjoyed apart
from company, and every pain becomes more cruel and intolerable." In a
remarkable passage, in which, after having long proceeded in enthusiasm
with his solitary labours, he seems to have stopped for a moment, and
recalling within himself the feelings and sympathies of an ordinary man,
to have reflected on the scope and tendency of the system in which he
was involving himself, he thus expresses himself, regarding its gloomy
tendency, and the effect it has in destroying, in the mind of its
fabricator, those stays of satisfactory belief in which it is so
comfortable for the wearied intellect to find a resting-place:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Before I launch out into those immense depths of philosophy
which lie before me, I find myself inclined to stop a <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_100" id="Page_v1_100">[100]</a></span>moment
in my present station, and to ponder that voyage which I have
undertaken, and which undoubtedly requires the utmost art and
industry to be brought to a happy conclusion. Methinks I am
like a man, who, having struck on many shoals, and having
narrowly escaped shipwreck in passing a small frith, has yet
the temerity to put out to sea in the same leaky
weather-beaten vessel, and even carries his ambition so far as
to think of compassing the globe under these disadvantageous
circumstances. My memory of past errors and perplexities makes
me diffident for the future. The wretched condition, weakness,
and disorder of the faculties, I must employ in my inquiries,
increase my apprehensions. And the impossibility of amending
or correcting these faculties, reduces me almost to despair,
and makes me resolve to perish on the barren rock, on which I
am at present, rather than venture myself upon that boundless
ocean which runs out into immensity. This sudden view of my
danger strikes me with melancholy; and, as 'tis usual for that
passion, above all others, to indulge itself, I cannot forbear
feeding my despair with all those desponding reflections which
the present subject furnishes me with in such abundance.</p>

<p>I am first affrighted and confounded with that forlorn
solitude in which I am placed in my philosophy, and fancy
myself some strange uncouth monster, who, not being able to
mingle and unite in society, has been expelled all human
commerce, and left utterly abandoned and disconsolate. Fain
would I run into the crowd for shelter and warmth, but cannot
prevail with myself to mix with such deformity. I call upon
others to join me, in order to make a company apart, but no
one will hearken to me. Every one keeps at a distance, and
dreads that storm which beats upon me from every side. I have
exposed myself to the enmity of all metaphysicians, logicians,
mathematicians, and even theologians; and can I wonder at the
insults I must suffer? I have declared my disapprobation of
their systems; and can I be surprised if they should express a
hatred of mine and of my person? When I look abroad, I foresee
on every side dispute, contradiction, anger, calumny, and
detraction. When I turn my eye inward, I find nothing but
doubt and ignorance. All the world conspires to oppose and
contradict me; <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_101" id="Page_v1_101">[101]</a></span>though such is my weakness, that I feel all my
opinions loosen and fall of themselves, when unsupported by
the approbation of others. Every step I take is with
hesitation, and every new reflection makes me dread an error
and absurdity in my reasoning.</p>

<p>For with what confidence can I venture upon such bold
enterprises, when, beside those numberless infirmities
peculiar to myself, I find so many which are common to human
nature? Can I be sure that, in leaving all established
opinions, I am following truth? and by what criterion shall I
distinguish her, even if fortune should at last guide me on
her footsteps? After the most accurate and exact of my
reasonings, I can give no reason why I should assent to it,
and feel nothing but a <em>strong</em> propensity to consider objects
<em>strongly</em> in that view under which they appear to me.<a name="FNanchor_101:1_45" id="FNanchor_101:1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:1_45" class="fnanchor">[101:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Occasionally, seduced by some impulse of playful candour, we find him
giving us admission as it were into the chamber of his thoughts, and
desiring that some one would drag him into the common circle of the
world. When there, he consents for a short time to comport himself as a
man, is social and sympathetic with his kind, and pleased with what is
passing around; when anon the ambition which had prompted his solitary
musings stirs his soul, tells him that in active life and the world at
large, the sphere of his true greatness is not placed, and prompts him
to reimprison himself, and pursue the great aim of his existence.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>But what have I here said, that reflections very refined and
metaphysical have little or no influence upon us? This opinion
I can scarce forbear retracting, and condemning from my
present feeling and experience. The <em>intense</em> view of these
manifold contradictions and imperfections in human reason has
so wrought upon me, and heated my brain, that I am ready to
reject all belief and reasoning, and can look upon no opinion
even as more probable or likely than another. Where am I, or
what? From what causes do I derive my <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_102" id="Page_v1_102">[102]</a></span>existence, and to what
condition shall I return? Whose favour shall I court, and
whose anger must I dread? What beings surround me? and on whom
have I any influence, or who have any influence on me? I am
confounded with all these questions, and begin to fancy myself
in the most deplorable condition imaginable, environed with
the deepest darkness, and utterly deprived of the use of every
member and faculty.</p>

<p>Most fortunately it happens, that since Reason is incapable of
dispelling these clouds, Nature herself suffices to that
purpose, and cures me of this philosophical melancholy and
delirium, either by relaxing this bent of mind, or by some
avocation, and lively impression of my senses, which
obliterate all these chimeras. I dine, I play a game of
backgammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends; and
when, after three or four hours' amusement, I would return to
these speculations, they appear so cold, and strained, and
ridiculous, that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them
any farther.</p>

<p>Here, then, I find myself absolutely and necessarily
determined to live, and talk, and act like other people in the
common affairs of life. But notwithstanding that my natural
propensity, and the course of my animal spirits and passions
reduce me to this indolent belief in the general maxims of the
world, I still feel such remains of my former disposition,
that I am ready to throw all my books and papers into the
fire, and resolve never more to renounce the pleasures of life
for the sake of reasoning and philosophy. For those are my
sentiments in that splenetic humour which governs me at
present. I may, nay I must yield to the current of nature, in
submitting to my senses and understanding; and in this blind
submission I show most perfectly my sceptical disposition and
principles. But does it follow that I must strive against the
current of nature, which leads me to indolence and pleasure;
that I must seclude myself, in some measure, from the commerce
and society of men, which is so agreeable; and that I must
torture my brain with subtilties and sophistries, at the very
time that I cannot satisfy myself concerning the
reasonableness of so painful an application, nor have any
tolerable prospect of arriving by its means at truth and
certainty? Under what obligation do I <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_103" id="Page_v1_103">[103]</a></span>lie of making such an
abuse of time? And to what end can it serve, either for the
service of mankind, or for my own private interest? No: if I
must be a fool, as all those who reason or believe any thing
<em>certainly</em> are, my follies shall at least be natural and
agreeable. Where I strive against my inclination, I shall have
a good reason for my resistance; and will no more be led
a-wandering into such dreary solitudes, and rough passages, as
I have hitherto met with.</p>

<p>These are the sentiments of my spleen and indolence; and
indeed I must confess, that philosophy has nothing to oppose
to them, and expects a victory more from the returns of a
serious good-humoured disposition, than from the force of
reason and conviction. In all the incidents of life, we ought
still to preserve our scepticism. If we believe that fire
warms, or water refreshes, 'tis only because it costs us too
much pains to think otherwise. Nay, if we are philosophers, it
ought only to be upon sceptical principles, and from an
inclination which we feel to the employing ourselves after
that manner. Where reason is lively, and mixes itself with
some propensity, it ought to be assented to. Where it does
not, it never can have any title to operate upon us.</p>

<p>At the time, therefore, that I am tired with amusement and
company, and have indulged a <em>reverie</em> in my chamber, or in a
solitary walk by a river side, I feel my mind all collected
within itself, and am naturally <em>inclined</em> to carry my view
into all those subjects, about which I have met with so many
disputes in the course of my reading and conversation. I
cannot forbear having a curiosity to be acquainted with the
principles of moral good and evil, the nature and foundation
of government, and the cause of those several passions and
inclinations which actuate and govern me. I am uneasy to think
I approve of one object, and disapprove of another; call one
thing beautiful, and another deformed; decide concerning truth
and falsehood, reason and folly, without knowing upon what
principles I proceed. I am concerned for the condition of the
learned world, which lies under such a deplorable ignorance in
all these particulars. I feel an ambition to arise in me of
contributing to the instruction of mankind, and of acquiring a
name by my inventions and discoveries. These sentiments spring
up naturally in my present disposition; <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_104" id="Page_v1_104">[104]</a></span>and should I
endeavour to banish them, by attaching myself to any other
business or diversion, I <em>feel</em> I should be a loser in point
of pleasure; and this is the origin of my philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_104:1_46" id="FNanchor_104:1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_104:1_46" class="fnanchor">[104:1]</a></p>

<p>The acuteness which the solitary metaphysician brought to his aid when
he chose to contemplate mankind, is not the least interesting feature in
his book. That he could have seen much of men, since his life had been
but brief and his converse with books great, is not probable; yet
Chesterfield and Rochefoucauld did not observe men more clearly and
truly, though they may have done so more extensively. The following
sketch of the mental features of a vain man, would not have been
unworthy of Theophrastus.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Every thing belonging to a vain man is the best that is any
where to be found. His houses, equipage, furniture, clothes,
horses, hounds, excel all others in his conceit; and 'tis easy
to observe, that from the least advantage in any of these, he
draws a new subject of pride and vanity. His wine, if you'll
believe him, has a finer flavour than any other; his cookery
is more exquisite; his table more orderly; his servant more
expert; the air in which he lives more healthful; the soil he
cultivates more fertile; his fruits ripen earlier, and to
greater perfection; such a thing is remarkable for its
novelty; such another for its antiquity: this is the
workmanship of a famous artist; that belonged to such a prince
or great man; all objects, in a word, that are useful,
beautiful, or surprising, or are related to such, may, by
means of property, give rise to this passion. These agree in

allusion to the intellectual faculties of the people of Bristol, in the
description of James Naylor's attempts to personify our Saviour, where
it is said, "he entered Bristol mounted on a horse&mdash;I suppose from the
difficulty in that place of finding an ass." Retrospect of manners &amp;c.,

<p><a name="Footnote_52:1_21" id="Footnote_52:1_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52:1_21"><span class="label">[52:1]</span></a> It is not improbable that the person here alluded to is
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Pluche</span>, a native of Rheims, the greatest literary ornament of
that city, and one who filled no small place in the lettered aristocracy
of France, where he held in many respects the position which Paley
occupied in England. He filled successively the chairs of Humanity and
Rhetoric, in the University of Rheims. His promotion in the Church was
checked by his partiality for Jansenism. He had the rare merit of
uniting to a firm belief in the great truths of Christianity a wide and
full toleration for the conscientious opinions of others; and he
enjoyed, what is no less rarely possessed by those who meddle in
theological disputes, the good opinion of his opponents. He was a great
scholar, and wrote some works on etymological and archæological
subjects; but he is chiefly known for his writings on natural theology,
celebrated for their clear and animated enunciation of the harmonies of
nature, and not only popular in their own country, but translated into
most of the European languages. His "Spectacle de la Nature," written in
a series of dialogues, was sketched while he acted as instructor to the
son of Lord Stafford; and the master and pupil, with the father and
mother of the latter, are the interlocutors. One of its main objects is,
by tracing effects in the operations of nature to their causes, to prove
and illustrate the beneficence and wisdom of the Deity. This work has
been a treasure to many an English schoolboy, in its well-known
translation, with the title, "Nature Displayed." An answer by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pluche</span> to
some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprits forts</i>, who wondered why a philosopher could believe so
much, has been preserved by his contemporaries: "It is more reasonable,"
he said, "to believe in the dictates of the Supreme Being than to follow
the feeble lights of a reason bounded in its operations and subject to
error."</p>

<p>It must be granted that what Hume calls the association of contrariety
has in some measure caused this digression, and that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Pluche</span>
would not have been so amply discussed as the possible learned man that
Hume had an introduction to, had there not been so much that is common
in the subjects treated of by both, and so much that is contrasted in
the mode of treatment. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pluche</span> was an opponent of Des Cartes, and thus a
name far greater than his, and as many will hold greater than Hume's, is
introduced into the circle of these local associations.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_53:1_22" id="Footnote_53:1_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53:1_22"><span class="label">[53:1]</span></a> The following passage in a recent work, Mrs. Shelley's
"Rambles in Germany and Italy," seems appropriate to this observation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By this time I became aware of a truth which had dawned on me before,
that the French common people have lost much of that grace of manner
which once distinguished them above all other people. More courteous
than the Italians they could not be; but, while their manners were more
artificial, they were more playful and winning. All this has changed. I
did not remark the alteration so much with regard to myself, as in their
mode of speaking to one another. The '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame</span>,' and '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span>,' with
which stable boys, and old beggar women, used to address each other with
the deference of courtiers, has vanished. No trace of it is to be found
in France; a shadow faintly exists among the Parisian shopkeepers when
speaking to their customers, but only there is the traditional
phraseology still used: The courteous accent, the soft manner, erst so
charming, exists no longer. I speak of a thing known and acknowledged by
the French themselves.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Their phraseology, once so delicately and even
to us more straightforward people, amusingly deferential (not to
superiors only, but toward one another,) is become blunt, and almost
rude. The French allege several causes for this change, which they date
from the Revolution of 1830: some say it arises from every citizen
turning out as one of the national guard in his turn, so that they all
get a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ton de garnison</i>: others attribute it to their imitation of the
English. Of course, in the times of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancien regime</i>, the courtly
tone found an echo and reflexion, from the royal anti-chambers down to
the very ends of the kingdom. This has faded by degrees, till the
Revolution of 1830 gave it the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-grâce</i>."</p>

Hume's character, this subject belongs to a later period of his

which seem to make it synonymous with transcendental, and referable
solely to the operations of pure reason, to the rejection of whatever is
founded on experiment, none of Hume's works are properly metaphysical;
and by the very foundation he has given to his philosophy, he has made
it empirical and consequently not metaphysical. The word metaphysical
is, however, here used in its ordinary, and, as it may be termed,
popular acceptation, and as applicable to any attempt to analyze mind or
describe its elements,&mdash;a subject in relation to which the word ontology
is also sometimes used.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_70:1_33" id="Footnote_70:1_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70:1_33"><span class="label">[70:1]</span></a> The term "ideas," in the philosophical nomenclature of
Hume, is thus used in a sense quite distinct from its previous current
acceptations, and as different from its vernacular use by Plato, in
reference to the archetypes of all the empirical objects of thought, as
from its employment by Locke, who used it to express "whatsoever is the
object of the understanding when a man thinks."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_75:1_34" id="Footnote_75:1_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75:1_34"><span class="label">[75:1]</span></a> "If we take as the utmost bounds of this system the
orbit Uranus, we shall find that it occupies a portion of space not less
than three thousand six hundred millions of miles in extent. The mind
fails to form an exact notion of a portion of space so immense; but some
faint idea of it may be obtained from the fact, that, if the swiftest
race-horse ever known, had begun to traverse it at full speed, at the
time of the birth of Moses, he could only as yet have accomplished half
his journey."&mdash;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, pp. 1-2.
Here an attempt is made to give a conception of abstract numbers, by
calling up in the mind the ideas deposited there from actual
impressions. Hume had, in the application of his theory to mathematics,
to struggle with the fact that no truths had a clearer and more distinct
existence in the mind than the abstract truths of the exact sciences;
and feeling the difficulty he thus had to encounter, he did not recur in
his subsequent works to this part of the sceptical theory. Kant seems to
have filled up the blank for him, by treating those truths as
synthetical intuitions anterior to experience in their abstract
existence, though depending on experience in the knowledge of their
concrete application; but it may be observed, that at the beginning of
sect. 4. of his Inquiry, Hume seems to have nearly anticipated some such
principle.</p>

impression must continue invariably the same, through the whole course
of our lives: since self is supposed to exist after that manner. But
there is no impression constant and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief
and joy, passions and sensations, succeed each other, and never all
exist at the same time. It cannot, therefore, be from any of these
impressions, or from any other, that the idea of self is derived; and
consequently there is no such idea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For my part, when I enter most
intimately into what I call <em>myself</em>, I always stumble on some
perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred,
pain or pleasure. I never can catch <em>myself</em> at any time without a
perception, and never can observe any thing but the
perception."&mdash;Treatise, B. i. p. iv. sect. 6.</p>

so great a philosopher as Reid saying, (Active Powers, ch. ix.) that on

have seen ignited bodies, had not data for concluding that that

Science, in an essay of the vanity of dogmatizing and confident
opinion." By Joseph Glanvill, M.A. 1665, 4to, p. 142. See this
coincidence commented on in the <cite>Penny Cyclopædia</cite>, art. Scepticism. The
style of Glanvill's work, in its rich variety of logical imagery and its
powerful use of antithesis, is formed on that of Sir Thomas Browne,
whose "Vulgar Errors" had been first published fifteen years earlier.
That one who wrote a book so full of wisdom&mdash;so bold, original, and firm
in its attacks on received fallacies, should also have been the champion
of belief in witchcraft, in which his prototype, Sir Thomas Browne, was
also a believer, is one of those inconsistencies in poor human nature,
which elicit much wonder, but no explanation. The following passages
from this curious and rare book are offered for the reader's
amusement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We conclude many things impossibilities, which yet are easie
<em>feasables</em>. For by an unadvised transiliency, leaping from the effect
to its remotest cause, we observe not the connexion through the
interposal of more immediate causalities, which yet at last bring the
extremes together without a miracle. And hereupon we hastily conclude
that <em>impossible</em> which we see not in the proximate capacity of its
<em>efficient</em>."&mdash;pp. 83-84.</p>

<p>"From this last-noted head ariseth that other of <em>joyning causes with
irrelevant effects</em>, which either refer not at all unto them, or in a
remoter capacity. Hence the Indian conceived so grossly of the <em>letter</em>
that discovered his theft; and that other who thought the watch an
<em>animal</em>. From hence grew the impostures of <em>charmes</em> and <em>amulets</em>, and
other insignificant ceremonies; which to this day impose upon common
belief, as they did of old upon the <em>barbarism</em> of the uncultivate
<em>heathen</em>. Thus effects unusual, whose causes run under ground, and are
more remote from ordinary discernment, are noted in the book of <em>vulgar
opinion</em> with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">digitus Deî</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dæmonis</i>; though they owe no other
dependence to the <em>first</em> than what is common to the whole <em>syntax</em> of
beings, nor yet any more to the <em>second</em> than what is given it by the
imagination of those unqualified judges. Thus, every unwonted <em>meteor</em>
is portentous; and the appearance of any unobserved <em>star</em>, some divine
<em>prognostick</em>. Antiquity thought <em>thunder</em> the immediate voyce of
<em>Jupiter</em>, and impleaded them of impiety that referred it to natural
causalities. Neither can there happen a <em>storm</em> at this remove from
<em>antique</em> ignorance, but the multitude will have the <em>Devil</em> in
it."&mdash;pp. 84-85.</p>

<p class="sectctr"><i>On the Influence of Education.</i></p>

<p>"We judge all things by our <em>anticipations</em>; and condemn or applaud
them, as they agree or differ from our <em>first receptions</em>. One country
laughs at the <em>laws</em>, <em>customs</em>, and <em>opinions</em> of another as absurd and
ridiculous; and the other is as charitable to them in its conceit of
theirs."&mdash;pp. 93-94.</p>

<p>"Thus, like the hermite, we think the sun shines nowhere but in our
cell, and all the world to be darkness but ourselves. We judge truth to
be circumscribed by the confines of our belief, and the doctrines we
were brought up in; and, with as ill manners as those of <em>China</em>, repute
all the rest of the world <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">monoculous</em>. So that, what some astrologers
say of our <em>fortunes</em> and the passages of our lives, may, by the
allowance of a metaphor, be said of our <em>opinions</em>&mdash;that they are
written in our <em>stars</em>, being to the most as fatal as those involuntary
occurrences, and as little in their power as the <em>placits</em> of <em>destiny</em>.
We are bound to our country's <em>opinions</em> as to its <em>laws</em>; and an
accustomed assent is tantamount to an infallible conclusion. He that
offers to dissent shall be an <em>outlaw</em> in reputation; and the fears of
guilty Cain shall be fulfilled on him&mdash;whoever meets him <em>shall slay
him</em>."&mdash;pp. 95-96.</p>

<p>"We look with superstitious reverence upon the accounts of preterlapsed
ages, and with a supercilious severity on the more deserving products of
our own&mdash;a vanity which hath possessed all times as well as ours; and
the <em>golden age</em> was never present.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We reverence gray-headed
doctrines, though feeble, decrepit, and within a step of dust: and on
this account maintain opinions which have nothing but our <em>charity</em> to
uphold them."&mdash;p. 102.</p>

pleased with such publications as those of Mr. Hume, and I do not think
it requires any great sagacity or strength of mind, to see that such
writings must be of great service to religion, natural and revealed.

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"London, February 13, 1739.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I thought to have wrote this from a place nearer you
than London, but have been detained here by contrary winds,
which have kept all Berwick ships from sailing. 'Tis now a
fortnight since my book was published; and, besides many other
considerations, I thought it would contribute very much to my
tranquillity, and might spare me many mortifications, to be in
the country while the success of the work was doubtful. I am
afraid 'twill remain so very long. Those who are accustomed to
reflect on such abstract subjects, are commonly full of
prejudices; and those who are unprejudiced are unacquainted
with metaphysical reasonings. My principles are also so remote
from all the vulgar sentiments on the subject, that were they
to take place, they would produce almost a total alteration in
philosophy; and you know, revolutions of this kind are not
easily brought about. I am young enough to see what will
become of the <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_106" id="Page_v1_106">[106]</a></span>matter; but am apprehensive lest the chief
reward I shall have for some time will be the pleasure of
studying on such important subjects, and the approbation of a
few judges. Among the rest, you may believe I aspire to your
approbation; and next to that, to your free censure and
criticism. I shall present you with a copy as soon as I come
to Scotland; and hope your curiosity, as well as friendship,
will make you take the pains of perusing it.</p>

<p>"If you know any body that is a judge, you would do me a
sensible pleasure in engaging him to a serious perusal of the
book. 'Tis so rare to meet with one that will take pains on a
book, that does not come recommended by some great name or
authority, that I must confess I am as fond of meeting with
such a one as if I were sure of his approbation. I am,
however, so doubtful in that particular, that I have
endeavoured all I could to conceal my name; though I believe I
have not been so cautious in this respect as I ought to have
been.</p>

not wait on him with your letter after he had arrived at that
dignity. At least I thought it would be to no purpose after I
began the printing. You'll excuse the frailty of an author in
writing so long a letter about nothing but his own
performances. Authors have this privilege in common with
lovers; and founded on the same reason, that they are both
besotted with a blind fondness of their object. I have been
upon my guard against this frailty; but perhaps this has
rather turned to my prejudice. The reflection on our caution
is apt to give us a more implicit <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_107" id="Page_v1_107">[107]</a></span>confidence afterwards, when

<p>To the same year we must attribute a letter from Hume to Michael Ramsay,
bearing no more precise date than 27th February. He says:&mdash;"As to
myself, no alteration has happened to my fortune: nor have I taken the
least step towards it. I hope things will be riper next winter; and I
would not aim at any thing till I could judge of my success in my grand
undertaking, and see upon what footing I shall stand in the world. I am
afraid, however, that I shall not have any great success of a sudden.
Such performances make their way very heavily at first, when they are
not recommended by any great name or authority."</p>

<p>In the same letter he speaks of Ramsay as being then a tutor in the
Marchmont family, and offers him this sage and business-like
advice:&mdash;"Should a living fall to the gift of the Duchess of
Marlborough, or any other of your friends and patrons, 'twould have but
an ill air to say that the gentleman was in the South of France, and
that he should be informed of the matter. Besides, you know how
necessary a man's presence is to quicken his friends, to make them unite
their interests, and to save them the trouble of contriving and thinking
about his affairs. Many a one may endeavour to serve you when you point
out the service you desire of them, who would not take the pains to find
it out themselves."<a name="FNanchor_107:2_50" id="FNanchor_107:2_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_107:2_50" class="fnanchor">[107:2]</a></p>

<p>Early in the year 1739, desiring apparently to await in retirement the
effect of his work on the mind of the public, he proceeded to Scotland,
and took up <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_108" id="Page_v1_108">[108]</a></span>his residence at Ninewells, whence we find him writing to
Henry Home on 1st June.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You see I am better than my word, having sent you
two papers instead of one. I have hints for two or three more,
which I shall execute at my leisure. I am not much in the
humour of such compositions at present, having received news
from London of the success of my Philosophy, which is but
indifferent, if I may judge by the sale of the book, and if I
may believe my bookseller. I am now out of humour with myself;
but doubt not, in a little time, to be only out of humour with
the world, like other unsuccessful authors. After all, I am
sensible of my folly in entertaining any discontent, much more
despair, upon this account, since I could not expect any
better from such abstract reasoning; nor, indeed, did I
promise myself much better. My fondness for what I imagined
new discoveries, made me overlook all common rules of
prudence; and, having enjoyed the usual satisfaction of
projectors, 'tis but just I should meet with their
disappointments. However, as 'tis observed with such sort of
people, one project generally succeeds another, I doubt not
but in a day or two I shall be as easy as ever, in hopes that
truth will prevail at last over the indifference and
opposition of the world.</p>

<p>"You see I might at present subscribe myself your most
<em>humble</em> servant with great propriety: but, notwithstanding,
shall presume to call myself your most affectionate friend as
well as humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_108:1_51" id="FNanchor_108:1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:1_51" class="fnanchor">[108:1]</a></p>

<p>His account of the success of his work in his "own <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_109" id="Page_v1_109">[109]</a></span>life," is contained
in these well-known sentences: "Never literary attempt was more
unfortunate than my 'Treatise of Human Nature.' It fell <em>dead born from
the press</em>, without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur
among the zealots." But he was never easily satisfied with the success
of his works; and we know that this one was not so entirely unnoticed by
the periodical press, such as it then was, but that it called forth a
long review in the number for November, 1739, of <cite>The History of the
Works of the Learned</cite>, a periodical which may be said to have set the
example in England, of systematic reviews of new books. This review is
written with considerable spirit, and has a few pretty powerful strokes
of sarcasm&mdash;as where, in relation to Hume's sceptical examination of the
results of the demonstrations of the geometricians, the writer says, "I
will have nothing to do in the quarrel; if they cannot maintain their
demonstrations against his attacks, they may even perish." The paper is
of considerable length, and it has throughout a tone of clamorous
jeering and vulgar raillery that forcibly reminds one of the writings of
Warburton. But it is the work of one who respects the adversary he has
taken arms against; and, before leaving the subject, the writer makes a
manly atonement for his wrath, saying of the Treatise,&mdash;"It bears,
indeed, incontestable marks of a great capacity, of a soaring genius,
but young and not yet thoroughly practised. The subject is vast and
noble as any that can exercise the understanding; but it requires a very
mature judgment to handle it as becomes its dignity and importance: the
utmost prudence, tenderness, and delicacy are requisite to this
desirable issue. Time and use may ripen these qualities in our author;
and we shall probably have reason to consider this, <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_110" id="Page_v1_110">[110]</a></span>compared with his
later productions, in the same light as we view the juvenile works of
Milton, or the first manner of a Raphael or other celebrated painter."</p>

<p>Immediately after Hume's death, there appeared in <cite>The London Review</cite>,
the following account of the manner in which he had acknowledged the
article in <cite>The Works of the Learned</cite>: "It does not appear our author
had acquired, at this period of his life, that command over his passions
of which he afterwards makes his boast. His disappointment at the public
reception of his 'Essay on Human Nature,' had, indeed, a violent effect
on his passions in a particular instance; it not having dropped so dead
born from the press but that it was severely handled by the reviewers of
those times, in a publication entitled <cite>The Works of the Learned</cite>. A
circumstance this which so highly provoked our young philosopher, that
he flew in a violent rage to demand satisfaction of Jacob Robinson, the
publisher, whom he kept, during the paroxysm of his anger, at his
sword's point, trembling behind the counter lest a period should be put
to the life of a sober critic by a raving philosopher."<a name="FNanchor_110:1_52" id="FNanchor_110:1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_110:1_52" class="fnanchor">[110:1]</a></p>

<p>This statement is in a note to a Review of Hume's "own life," and it has
after it the letters "Rev." which serve to give it the attestation of
William Shakespeare Kenrick, the editor of <cite>The London Review</cite>, and a
man whose sole title to literary remembrance rests on the hardy
effrontery and deadly spite of his falsehoods. There is nothing in the
story to make it in itself incredible&mdash;for Hume was far from being that
docile mass of imperturbability, which so large a portion of the world
have taken him for. But the anecdote requires authentication; and has it
<!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_111" id="Page_v1_111">[111]</a></span>not. Moreover, there are circumstances strongly against its truth. Hume
was in Scotland at the time when the criticism on his work was
published: he did not visit London for some years afterwards; and, to
believe the story, we must look upon it not as a momentary ebullition of
passion, but as a manifestation of long-treasured resentment,&mdash;a
circumstance inconsistent with his character, inconsistent with human
nature in general, and not in keeping with the modified tone of
dissatisfaction with the criticism, evinced in his correspondence.</p>

<p>While Hume was preparing for the press the third part of his "Treatise
of Human Nature,"&mdash;on the subject of Morals, Francis Hutcheson, then
professor of moral philosophy in the university of Glasgow, was enjoying
a reputation in the philosophical world scarcely inferior to that of
either of his great contemporaries, Berkeley and Wolff. From the
following correspondence it will be seen that Hume submitted the
manuscript of his forthcoming volume to Hutcheson's inspection; and he
shows more inclination to receive with deference the suggestions of that
distinguished man, than to allow himself to be influenced from any other
quarter. But still, it will be observed that it is only in details that
he receives instruction, and that he vigorously supports the fundamental
principles of his system. The correspondence illustrates the method in
which he held himself as working with human nature&mdash;not as an artist,
but an anatomist, whose minute critical examinations might be injured by
any bursts of feeling or eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_111:1_53" id="FNanchor_111:1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_111:1_53" class="fnanchor">[111:1]</a> The letters show how far he
saw into the depths of the utilitarian system; and prove that it was
more <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_112" id="Page_v1_112">[112]</a></span>completely formed in his mind than it appeared in his book.
Notions of prudence appear to have restrained him, at that time, from
issuing so full a development of the system as that which he afterwards
published; but he soon discovered that it was not in that department of
his works that he stood on the most dangerous ground.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Francis Hutcheson</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Ninewells, 17th Sept. 1739.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged to you for your reflections on my
papers. I have perused them with care, and find they will be
of use to me. You have mistaken my meaning in some passages,
which, upon examination, I have found to proceed from some
ambiguity or defect in my expression.</p>

<p>"What affected me most in your remarks, is your observing that
there wants a certain warmth in the cause of virtue, which you
think all good men would relish, and could not displease
amidst abstract inquiries. I must own this has not happened by
chance, but is the effect of a reasoning either good or bad.
There are different ways of examining the mind, as well as the
body. One may consider it either as an anatomist or as a
painter: either to discover its most secret springs and
principles, or to describe the grace and beauty of its
actions. I imagine it impossible to conjoin these two views.
Where you pull off the skin, and display all the minute parts,
there appears something trivial, even in the noblest attitudes
and most vigorous actions; nor can you ever render the object
graceful or engaging, but by clothing the parts again with
skin and flesh, and presenting only their bare outside. An
anatomist, however, can give very <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_113" id="Page_v1_113">[113]</a></span>good advice to a painter or
statuary. And, in like manner, I am persuaded that a
metaphysician may be very helpful to a moralist, though I
cannot easily conceive these two characters united in the same
work. Any warm sentiment of morals, I am afraid, would have
the air of declamation amidst abstract reasonings, and would
be esteemed contrary to good taste. And though I am much more
ambitious of being esteemed a friend to virtue than a writer
of taste, yet I must always carry the latter in my eye,
otherwise I must despair of ever being serviceable to virtue.
I hope these reasons will satisfy you; though at the same time
I intend to make a new trial, if it be possible to make the
moralist and metaphysician agree a little better.</p>

<p>"I cannot agree to your sense of <em>natural</em>. 'Tis founded on
final causes, which is a consideration that appears to me
pretty uncertain and unphilosophical. For, pray, what is the
end of man? Is he created for happiness, or for virtue? for
this life, or for the next? for himself, or for his Maker?
Your definition of <em>natural</em> depends upon solving these
questions, which are endless, and quite wide of my purpose. I
have never called justice unnatural, but only artificial.
'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atque ipsa utilitas, justi prope mater et æqui</i>,'<a name="FNanchor_113:1_54" id="FNanchor_113:1_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_113:1_54" class="fnanchor">[113:1]</a>
says one of the best moralists of antiquity. Grotius and
Puffendorf, to be consistent, must assert the same.</p>

<p>"Whether natural abilities be virtue, is a dispute of words. I
think I follow the common use of language; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virtus</i> signified
chiefly courage among the Romans. I was just now reading this
character of Alexander VI. in Guicciardin. '<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">In Alessandro
sesto fu solertia et sagacità singulare: consiglio eccellente,
efficacia a <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_114" id="Page_v1_114">[114]</a></span>persuadere maravigliosa, et a tutte le faccende
gravi, sollicitudine, et destrezza incredibile. Ma erano
queste virtù avanzate di grande intervallo da vitii.</span>'<a name="FNanchor_114:1_55" id="FNanchor_114:1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:1_55" class="fnanchor">[114:1]</a>
Were benevolence the only virtue, no characters could be
mixed, but would depend entirely on their degrees of
benevolence. Upon the whole, I desire to take my catalogue of
virtues from 'Cicero's Offices,' not from 'The Whole Duty of
Man.' I had indeed the former book in my eye in all my
reasonings.</p>

<p>"I have many other reflections to communicate to you; but it
would be troublesome. I shall therefore conclude with telling
you, that I intend to follow your advice in altering most of
those passages you have remarked as defective in point of
prudence; though, I must own, I think you a little too
delicate. Except a man be in orders, or be immediately
concerned in the instruction of youth, I do not think his
character depends upon his philosophical speculations, as the
world is now modelled; and a little liberty seems requisite to
bring into the public notice a book that is calculated for few
readers. I hope you will allow me the freedom of consulting
you when I am in any difficulty, and believe me," &amp;c.</p>

<p class="section">"P.S.&mdash;I cannot forbear recommending another thing to your
consideration. Actions are not virtuous nor vicious, but only
so far as they are proofs of certain qualities or durable
principles in the mind. This is a point I should have
established more expressly than I have done. Now, I desire you
to consider if <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_115" id="Page_v1_115">[115]</a></span>there be any quality that is virtuous, without
having a tendency either to the public good or to the good of
the person who possesses it. If there be none without these
tendencies, we may conclude that their merit is derived from
sympathy. I desire you would only consider the <em>tendencies</em> of
qualities, not their actual operations, which depend on
chance. <em>Brutus</em> riveted the chains of <em>Rome</em> faster by his
opposition; but the natural tendency of his noble
dispositions&mdash;his public spirit and magnanimity&mdash;was to
establish her liberty.</p>

<p>"You are a great admirer of <em>Cicero</em> as well as I am. Please
to review the fourth book <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</cite>:
where you find him prove against the <em>Stoics</em>, that if there
be no other goods but virtue, 'tis impossible there can be any
virtue, because the mind would then want all motives to begin
its actions upon; and 'tis on the goodness or badness of the
motives that the virtue of the action depends. This proves,
that to every virtuous action there must be a motive or
impelling passion distinct from the virtue, and that virtue
can never be the sole motive to any action. You do not assent
to this: though I think there is no proposition more certain
or important. I must own my proofs were not distinct enough
and must be altered. You see with what reluctance I part with
you, though I believe it is time I should ask your pardon for
so much trouble."</p>
</div>

<p>In the mean time we find Hume anxious to be employed in the capacity of
a travelling governor or tutor, and writing to Mr. George Carre of
Nisbet, intimating his readiness to officiate to that gentleman's
cousins, Lord Haddington and Mr. Baillie, if there are no favoured
candidates for the situation. There <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_116" id="Page_v1_116">[116]</a></span>is nothing in the letter to excite
much interest.<a name="FNanchor_116:1_56" id="FNanchor_116:1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:1_56" class="fnanchor">[116:1]</a> He says, he hears the young gentlemen are
proposing to travel; observes that he has the honour to be their
relation, "which gives a governor a better air in attending his pupils,"
and that he has some leisure time. In his letter to a physician, in the
preceding chapter, we find him mentioning this office as one of the few
to which his prospects were limited, and, at the same time, as one for
which his knowledge of the world scarcely fitted him. His six years'
farther experience of life had perhaps in his own opinion provided him
with opportunities of better qualifying himself for the duties of this
office. It was held by many able and accomplished men at that time, and
appears to have been the profession of his friend Michael Ramsay. There
are no traces of the manner in which his application was received.</p>

<p>From such matters as these, one readily turns with interest to the most
trifling notices connected with his literary history. On 4th March,
1740, we find him thus writing to Hutcheson.</p>

<p>"My bookseller has sent to Mr. Smith a copy of my book, which I hope he
has received, as well as your letter. I have not yet heard what he has
done with the abstract; perhaps you have. I have got it printed in
London, but not in <cite>The Works of the Learned</cite>, there having been an
article with regard to my book, somewhat abusive, printed in that work,
before I sent up the abstract."<a name="FNanchor_116:2_57" id="FNanchor_116:2_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:2_57" class="fnanchor">[116:2]</a></p>

<p>The "Smith" here mentioned as receiving a copy of the Treatise, we may
fairly conclude, notwithstanding the universality of the name, to be
Adam Smith, who was then a student in the university of Glasgow, <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_117" id="Page_v1_117">[117]</a></span>and
not quite seventeen years old.<a name="FNanchor_117:1_58" id="FNanchor_117:1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_117:1_58" class="fnanchor">[117:1]</a> It may be inferred from Hume's
letter, that Hutcheson had mentioned Smith as a person on whom it would
serve some good purpose to bestow a copy of the Treatise: and we have
here, evidently, the first introduction to each other's notice, of two
friends, of whom it can be said, that there was no third person writing
the English language during the same period, who has had so much
influence upon the opinions of mankind as either of these two men.</p>

<p>The correspondence with Hutcheson is continued as follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Francis Hutcheson</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"16th March,1740.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I must trouble you to write that letter you was so
kind as to offer to Longman the bookseller. I concluded
somewhat of a hasty bargain with my bookseller, from indolence
and an aversion to bargaining: as also because I was told that
few or no bookseller would engage for one edition with a new
author. I was also determined to keep my name a secret for
some time, though I find I have failed in that point. I sold
one edition of these two volumes for fifty guineas, and also
engaged myself heedlessly in a clause, which may prove
troublesome, viz. that upon printing a second edition I shall
take all the copies remaining upon hand at the bookseller's
price at the time. 'Tis in order to have some check upon my
bookseller, that I would willingly engage with another: and I
doubt not but your recommendation would be very serviceable to
me, even though you be not personally acquainted with him.</p>

<p>"I wait with some impatience for a second edition,
<!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_118" id="Page_v1_118">[118]</a></span>principally on account of alterations I intend to make in my
performance. This is an advantage that we authors possess
since the invention of printing, and renders the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nonum
prematur in annum</i> not so necessary to us as to the ancients.
Without it I should have been guilty of a very great temerity,
to publish at my years so many novelties in so delicate a part
of philosophy; and at any rate, I am afraid that I must plead
as my excuse that very circumstance of youth which may be
urged against me. I assure you, that without running any of
the heights of scepticism, I am apt in a cool hour to suspect,
in general, that most of my reasonings will be more useful by
furnishing hints and exciting people's curiosity, than as
containing any principles that will augment the stock of
knowledge, that must pass to future ages.<a name="FNanchor_118:1_59" id="FNanchor_118:1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_118:1_59" class="fnanchor">[118:1]</a> I wish I
could discover more fully the particulars wherein I have
failed. I admire so much the candour I have observed in Mr.
Locke, yourself, and a very few more, that I would be
extremely ambitious of imitating it, by frankly confessing my
errors. If I do not imitate it, it must proceed neither from
my being free from errors nor want of inclination, but from my
real unaffected ignorance. I shall consider more carefully all
the particulars you mention to me: though with regard to
<em>abstract ideas</em>, 'tis with difficulty I can entertain a doubt
on that head, notwithstanding your authority. Our conversation
together has furnished me a hint, with which I shall augment
the second edition. 'Tis this&mdash;the word <em>simple idea</em> is an
abstract term, comprehending different individuals that are
similar. Yet the point of their similarity, from the very
nature of such ideas, is not distinct nor separable from the
rest. Is not this a proof, among many others, that <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_119" id="Page_v1_119">[119]</a></span>there may
be a similarity without any possible separation even in
thought.</p>

<p>"I must consult you in a point of prudence. I have concluded a
reasoning with these two sentences: 'When you pronounce any
action or character to be vicious, you mean nothing but that,
from the particular constitution of your nature, you have a
feeling or sentiment of blame from the contemplation of it.
Vice and virtue, therefore, may be compared to sounds,
colours, heat, and cold, which, according to modern
philosophy, are not qualities in objects, but perceptions in
the mind. And this discovery in morals, like that other in
physics, is to be regarded as a mighty advancement of the
speculative sciences, though like that too it has little or no
influence on practice.'<a name="FNanchor_119:1_60" id="FNanchor_119:1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:1_60" class="fnanchor">[119:1]</a></p>

<p>"Is not this laid a little too strong? I desire your opinion
of it, though I cannot entirely promise to conform myself to
it. I wish from my heart I could avoid concluding, that since
morality, according to your opinion, as well as mine, is
determined merely by sentiment, it regards only human nature
and human life. This has been often urged against you, and the
consequences are very momentous. If you make any alterations
in your performances, I can assure you, there are many who
desire you would more fully consider this point, if you think
that the truth lies on the popular side. Otherwise common
prudence, your character, and situation, forbid you [to] touch
upon it. If morality were determined by reason, that is the
same to all rational beings; but <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_120" id="Page_v1_120">[120]</a></span>nothing but experience can
assure us that the sentiments are the same. What experience
have we with regard to superior beings? How can we ascribe to
them any sentiments at all? They have implanted those
sentiments in us for the conduct of life like our bodily
sensations, which they possess not themselves. I expect no
answer to these difficulties in the compass of a letter. 'Tis
enough if you have patience to read so long a letter as
this.&mdash;I am." &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>The third volume of the "Treatise of Human Nature" being the part
relating to morals, was published by Thomas Longman in 1740. It is not
so original as the metaphysical part of the work, nor are its principles
so clearly and decidedly laid down. Its author's metaphysical theories
were rather modified than confirmed in his subsequent works. But his
opinions on ethical subjects, only indistinctly shadowed forth in his
early work, were afterwards reduced to a more compact system, and were
more clearly and fully set forth.</p>

<p>The metaphysical department of the Treatise is a system with a great
leading principle throughout, of which its author intended that all the
details should be but the individual applications. If his reasoning in
that department of his work be accurate, he sweeps away all other
systems of the foundation of knowledge, and substitutes another in their
stead. But the third book, "on Morals," like the second, on "the
Passions," has no such pretension. The leading principles of the
metaphysical department are certainly kept in view, but the details are
not necessarily parts of it. They have a separate existence of their
own: they are an analysis of phenomena which we witness in our daily
life; and the reader assents or dissents as the several <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_121" id="Page_v1_121">[121]</a></span>opinions
expressed correspond with or diverge from his own observation of what he
sees passing in the world around him, without, in that mental operation,
either receiving or rejecting any general theory. In short, it is to a
considerable extent a series of observations of human conduct and
character; and as such they are admitted or denied, are sympathized with
or contemned, according to the previous feelings and opinions of the
reader. Among the prominent features of the theoretical part of this
book, is the admission of a moral sense,<a name="FNanchor_121:1_61" id="FNanchor_121:1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_121:1_61" class="fnanchor">[121:1]</a> but the negation of an
abstract code of morality, separately existing, and independent of the
position of the persons who are applying this sense. The work in some
measure foreshadows the systems which have been respectively called the
utilitarian and the selfish; the former applying as the scale of moral
excellence the extent to which an action is beneficial or hurtful to the
human race; the latter referring the actions of mankind, whether good or
bad, interested or disinterested, to self, and to impulses which are
always connected with the individual in whom they act, and his passions
or desires.</p>

<p>In this respect it had its influence, when joined to other hints thrown
out by philosophers, in supplying the texts on which Helvetius,
Beccaria, and Bentham discoursed at greater length and with a clearer
application to definite systems. The utilitarian principle Hume
afterwards extended and rendered systematic, in pursuance of the views
announced in his correspondence with Hutcheson. In connexion with what
is <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_122" id="Page_v1_122">[122]</a></span>called the "selfish system" of morals, he went no farther than to
point out that the source of every impulse must have its relation to the
individual person on whom that impulse acts. If it be the sordid impulse
of the miser, it must be because the man who feels it loves gold; if it
be the profuse impulse of the spendthrift, it must be because the
individual who spends has a corresponding desire within himself; if it
be the charitable impulse of the person who feeds the poor, it must be
because that person is under the influence of inducements which incline
him rather to do so than not do so. If the principle be applied to a
martyr suffering for conscience sake, or to a soldier who prefers death
to submission, it is still because the person who acts fulfils impulses
acting on himself. But this is a subject from which Hume appears to have
shrunk in his subsequent works. He seems to have disliked the character
of being connected with "the selfish school;" and he thus failed to
revert to a subject on which his rigid and clear examination would have
been a matter of greater interest, than his merely arguing against
self-interest being the proper rule of action&mdash;an argument that with him
amounts to nothing more than a protest against that vulgarization of the
system, which charges it with such a doctrine for the purpose of
rendering it odious. We shall afterwards find that he had a
correspondence on this subject with Helvetius, who wished to bring him
over to the admission of his own opinions.</p>

<p>In this department of the Treatise there are some inquiries into the
first principles of law and government. Here, if any where, he shows the
influence over his mind of his reading in the works of the civilians.
His own utilitarian principle, when carried out on these subjects, shows
that the best government <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_123" id="Page_v1_123">[123]</a></span>is that which is most conducive to the welfare
of the community. But he occasionally mixes up this principle with
elements totally heterogeneous to it&mdash;as in those instances where he
considers the privilege of governing as held by the same tenure with the
right of property, and views the question whether any particular
government is good or bad, in its effect upon the persons governed, as
secondary to the question whether it is or is not held by a good tenure
when it is considered as if it were a matter of private property. But,
notwithstanding these inconsistencies, which he afterwards amended when
he had more fully investigated the principles of politics, the general
aim of his observations on the sources of government is to show that
they are to be found in reason, and to dispel the various irrational and
superstitious notions of political authority, which are comprehended in
the use of the term Divine Right. Indeed, the observations which he
makes with a practical application to governments, are a partial
anticipation of the clear good sense which distinguished his subsequent
political essays. In connexion with the motives of that insurrection
which occurred within eight years after the publication of the Treatise,
and with the partiality for high monarchical principles with which
Hume's name is so much associated, the following remarks are interesting
and instructive.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Whoever considers the history of the several nations of the
world, their revolutions, conquests, increase and diminution,
the manner in which their particular governments are
established, and the successive right transmitted from one
person to another, will soon learn to treat very lightly all
disputes concerning the rights of princes, and will be
convinced that a strict adherence to any general rules, and
the rigid loyalty to particular persons and families, on
which <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_124" id="Page_v1_124">[124]</a></span>some people set so high a value, are virtues that hold
less of reason than of bigotry and superstition. In this
particular, the study of history confirms the reasonings of
true philosophy, which, showing us the original qualities of
human nature, teaches us to regard the controversies in
politics as incapable of any decision in most cases, and as
entirely subordinate to the interests of peace and liberty.
Where the public good does not evidently demand a change, 'tis
certain that the concurrence of all those titles, <em>original
contract</em>, <em>long possession</em>, <em>present possession</em>,
<em>succession</em>, and <em>positive laws</em>, forms the strongest title
to sovereignty, and is justly regarded as sacred and
inviolable. But when these titles are mingled and opposed in
different degrees, they often occasion perplexity, and are
less capable of solution from the arguments of lawyers and
philosophers, than from the swords of the soldiery. Who shall
tell me, for instance, whether Germanicus or Drusus ought to
have succeeded Tiberius, had he died while they were both
alive, without naming any of them for his successor? Ought the
right of adoption to be received as equivalent to that of
blood, in a nation where it had the same effect in private
families, and had already, in two instances, taken place in
the public? Ought Germanicus to be esteemed the eldest son,
because he was born before Drusus; or the younger, because he
was adopted after the birth of his brother? Ought the right of
the elder to be regarded in a nation, where the eldest brother
had no advantage in the succession to private families? Ought
the Roman empire at that time to be esteemed hereditary,
because of two examples; or ought it, even so early, to be
regarded as belonging to the stronger, or the present
possessor, as being founded on so recent an usurpation? Upon
whatever principles we may pretend to answer these and
such-like questions, I am afraid we shall never be able to
satisfy an impartial inquirer, who adopts no party in
political controversies, and will be satisfied with nothing
but sound reason and philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_124:1_62" id="FNanchor_124:1_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_124:1_62" class="fnanchor">[124:1]</a></p>

<p>Some of Hume's notes, of matters which have occurred to him in the
course of his reading as worthy of observation, or of remarkable
thoughts passing through <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_125" id="Page_v1_125">[125]</a></span>his mind, have been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_125:1_63" id="FNanchor_125:1_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_125:1_63" class="fnanchor">[125:1]</a> They
appear to be merely a few stray leaves, which have accidentally survived
the loss of many others, as the number of subjects to which they refer
is limited in comparison with the wide compass of knowledge embraced in
Hume's various works. The specimens so preserved, appear generally to
have been written at this period of his life, with the exception,
perhaps, of those which are printed above, and which have reference to
physical science.<a name="FNanchor_125:2_64" id="FNanchor_125:2_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_125:2_64" class="fnanchor">[125:2]</a> They are set down with clearness and precision,
as if by one who knew both the step in a series of reasoning to which
each of them belongs, and the form in which it should be expressed. They
are written on long sheets of paper; and unless the few that appear
under the head "Natural Philosophy," and some which have the general
heading "Philosophy," they appear to have been subjected to no system of
pre-arrangement, such as that which Locke suggested, but to have been
set down according as the fruits of the annotator's reading or thought
presented themselves to him. A few specimens are here given: they will
be found to have been chiefly made use of in the "Natural History of
Religion," and in the "Essay on the Populousness of Ancient Nations,"
while a few of them&mdash;as for instance that relating to Gustavus
Vasa&mdash;make their appearance in the little volume of "Essays, Moral and
Political," published in 1741.<a name="FNanchor_125:3_65" id="FNanchor_125:3_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_125:3_65" class="fnanchor">[125:3]</a> A considerable proportion of them

It is an occurrence quite characteristic of the friendship of these two
great men, that either of them should have supplied the other with facts

<p class="center">EXTRACTS FROM A COLLECTION OF MEMORANDUMS.</p>

<p>Perhaps the custom of allowing parents to murder their infant
children, though barbarous, tends to render a state more
populous, as in China. Many marry by that inducement; and such
is the force of natural affection, that none make use of that
privilege but in extreme necessity.</p>

<p>A pound of steel, when manufactured, may become of £10,000

<p>No hospitals in Holland have any land or settled revenue, and

<p>The Romans had two ways chiefly of levying their taxes,&mdash;by
public lands, which were all dissipated by popular tribunes
about the end of the republic; or by customs upon importation,
which were different in different places; in some the fortieth
part of the value; in Sicily the twentieth.</p>

<p>They had also a kind of excise, which began with the emperors,
and was the two-hundredth or one-hundredth part of the value
of all goods sold, the fiftieth of slaves.</p>

<p>Beside this, they had pretty early, even in the time of the
republic, duties upon mines and salt; and in order to levy the
former more easily, they forbid all mines in Italy. Their
mines near Carthagena <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_127" id="Page_v1_127">[127]</a></span>yielded them 25,000 drachms a-day.

<p>In the time of the monarchy, the kings had the sole power of
imposing taxes. In the time of the republic, 'tis strange to
see this power belonging sometimes to the magistrates,
sometimes to the senate, or to the people. We learn from Livy,
in the second Punic War, that the senate could contract debt
alone. Polybius says, that all money matters belonged to the
senate. The censors levied all the taxes, and farmed them out
to the Roman knights. The Romans could be no great
politicians; since the senate could not gain the sovereignty,
nor the censors the supreme magistracy, notwithstanding these
advantages.</p>

<p>Machiavel makes it a question, whether absolute power is best

nobles.</p>

<p>Thrasybulus restoring the people, and Cæsar's conquest, the

<p>There seems to be a natural course of things which brings on
the destruction of great empires. They push their conquests
till they come to barbarous nations, which stop their progress
by the difficulty of subsisting great armies. After that, the
nobility and considerable men of the conquering nation and
best provinces withdraw gradually from the frontier army, by
reason of its distance from the capital, and barbarity of the
country in which they quarter. They forget the use of war.
Their barbarous soldiers become their masters. These have no
law but their <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_134" id="Page_v1_134">[134]</a></span>sword, both from their bad education, and from

<p>The accounts we have of the sentiments of the ancient

allowed the ordering of the world by a mind, and in saying
that Anaxagoras was the first.</p>

<p>Strato's atheism the most dangerous of the <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_135" id="Page_v1_135">[135]</a></span>ancient&mdash;holding
the origin of the world from nature, or a matter endued with
activity. Bayle thinks there are none but the Cartesians can
refute this atheism.</p>

<p>A Stratonician could retort the arguments of all the sects of
philosophy. Of the Stoics, who maintained their God to be
fiery and compound; and of the Platonicians, who asserted the
ideas to be distinct from the Deity. The same question,&mdash;Why
the parts or ideas of God had that particular arrangement?&mdash;is
as difficult as why the world had.</p>

<p>Some pretend that there can be no necessity, according to the
system of atheism, "because even matter cannot be determined
without something superior to determine it."&mdash;<cite>Fenelon.</cite></p>

<p>Three proofs of the existence of a God: 1st, Some thing
necessarily existent, and what is so is infinitely perfect.
2d, The idea of infinite must come from an infinite being. 3d,
The idea of infinite perfection implies that of actual
existence.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable story to confirm the Cartesian
philosophy of the brain. A man hurt by the fall of a horse,
forgot about twenty years of his life, and remembered what
went before in a much more lively manner than usual.</p>

</div>


<p class="section">A small duodecimo volume, the first of the "Essays Moral and Political,"
was published at Edinburgh in 1741, and the second was published in
1742. The publication was anonymous; and it is remarkable that, although
thus shielded, Hume appears to have, at that early period, been so
anxious to disconnect himself with the authorship of the Treatise, that,
in the advertisement, he addresses his readers as if he were then
appearing as an author for the first time. "Most of these essays," he
says, "were wrote with a view of being published as weekly papers, and
were intended to comprehend the designs both of the Spectators and
Craftsmen. But, having dropt that undertaking, partly from laziness,
partly from want of leisure, and being willing to make trial of my
talents for writing before I ventured upon any more serious
compositions, I was induced to commit these trifles to the judgment of
the public. Like most new authors, I must confess I feel some anxiety
concerning the success of my work; but one thing makes me more
secure,&mdash;that the reader may condemn my abilities, but must approve of
my moderation and impartiality in my method of handling political
subjects; and, as long as my moral character is in safety, <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_137" id="Page_v1_137">[137]</a></span>I can, with
less anxiety, abandon my learning and capacity to the most severe
censure and examination."</p>

<p>Some of the subjects of these essays were not less untrodden at the time
when they appeared, than they are hackneyed in the present day. Of these
may be cited, "The Liberty of the Press;" "The Parties of Great
Britain;" "The Independency of Parliament." When they are compared with
the <cite>Craftsman</cite>, with <cite>Mist's Journal</cite>, and with the other periodicals
of the day, which had set the example of discussing such subjects, these
essays as little resemble their precursors, as De Lolme's "Remarks on
the British Constitution" do the articles in a daily London party paper.
Whatever he afterwards became, Hume was at that time no party
politician. He retained the Stoic severity of thought with which we have
found that he had sixteen years previously invested himself; and would
allow the excitements or rewards of no party in the state to drag him
out of the even middle path of philosophical observation. There is
consequently a wonderful impartiality in these essays, and an acuteness
of observation, which to the reader, who keeps in view how little the
true workings of the constitution were noticed in that day, is not less
remarkable. How completely, for instance, has the wisdom of the
following observations in the essay on "The Liberty of the Press," been
justified by the experience of a century.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>We need not dread from this liberty any such ill consequences
as followed from the harangues of the popular demagogues of
Athens and tribunes of Rome. A man reads a book or pamphlet
alone and coolly. There is none present from whom he can catch
the passion by contagion. He is not hurried away by the force
and energy of action. And should he be wrought up to never so
seditious a humour, there <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_138" id="Page_v1_138">[138]</a></span>is no violent resolution presented
to him by which he can immediately vent his passion. The
liberty of the press, therefore, however abused, can scarce
ever excite popular tumults or rebellion. And as to those
murmurs or secret discontents it may occasion, 'tis better
they should get vent in words, that they may come to the
knowledge of the magistrate before it be too late, in order to
his providing a remedy against them. Mankind, 'tis true, have
always a greater propension to believe what is said to the
disadvantage of their governors than the contrary; but this
inclination is inseparable from them whether they have liberty
or not. A whisper may fly as quick, and be as pernicious as a
pamphlet. Nay, it will be more pernicious, where men are not
accustomed to think freely, or distinguish betwixt truth and
falsehood.</p>

<p>It has also been found, as the experience of mankind
increases, that the <em>people</em> are no such dangerous monster as
they have been represented, and that 'tis in every respect
better to guide them like rational creatures, than to lead or
drive them like brute beasts. Before the United Provinces set
the example, toleration was deemed incompatible with good
government; and 'twas thought impossible that a number of
religious sects could live together in harmony and peace, and
have all of them an equal affection to their common country
and to each other. England has set a like example of civil
liberty; and though this liberty seems to occasion some small
ferment at present, it has not as yet produced any pernicious
effects; and it is to be hoped that men, being every day more
accustomed to the free discussion of public affairs, will
improve in their judgment of them, and be with greater
difficulty seduced by every idle rumour and popular clamour.</p>

<p>'Tis a very comfortable reflection to the lovers of liberty,
that this peculiar privilege of Britain is of a kind that
cannot easily be wrested from us, and must last as long as our
government remains in any degree free and independent. 'Tis
seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once. Slavery
has so frightful an aspect to men accustomed to freedom, that
it must steal in upon them by decrees, and must disguise
itself in a thousand shapes in order to be received. But if
the liberty of the press ever be lost, it must <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_139" id="Page_v1_139">[139]</a></span>be lost at
once. The general laws against sedition and libelling are at
present as strong as they possibly can be made. Nothing can
impose a farther restraint but either the clapping an
imprimatur upon the press, or the giving very large
discretionary powers to the court to punish whatever
displeases them. But these concessions would be such a
barefaced violation of liberty, that they will probably be the
last efforts of a despotic government. We may conclude that
the liberty of Britain is gone for ever when these attempts
shall succeed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The opinion generally acceded to at the present day, that ministerial
and judicial functions should be intrusted to responsible individuals,
and not to bodies of men who may individually escape from a joint
responsibility, is anticipated in the following passage:&mdash;"Honour is a
great check upon mankind; but where a considerable body of men act
together, this check is in a great measure removed, since a man is sure
to be approved of by his own party for what promotes the common
interest, and he soon learns to despise the clamour of
adversaries."<a name="FNanchor_139:1_67" id="FNanchor_139:1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_139:1_67" class="fnanchor">[139:1]</a> The Grenville Act, and the subsequent measures for
reducing the number of the judges on controverted elections, are a
practical commentary on the truth of this remark.</p>

<p>It has often been observed, that foreigners have been the first to
remark the leading peculiarities of the British constitution, and of the
administration of justice in this country, in a manner rational and
unimpassioned, yet so as to give them greater prominence, and a more
full descriptive development than they obtain from our own impassioned
party writers&mdash;an observation attested by the character which the works
of Montesquieu and De Lolme held in the preceding century, and those of
Thierry, Cottu, Meyer, and Raumer, have obtained in the present.
<!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_140" id="Page_v1_140">[140]</a></span>The reason of this superiority is to be sought in the circumstance that
the acuteness of these foreign observers was not obscured, or their
feelings excited, by any connexion with the workings of the systems they
have described; and the isolation from active life in which Hume was
placed, appears to have in some measure given him like qualifications
for the examination of our political institutions. He expresses a
general partiality for the monarchical government of Britain, but it is
a partiality of a calm utilitarian character, which would not be
inconsistent with an equally great esteem for a well-ordered republic.
On his philosophical appreciation of its merits, the monarchy has no
stronger claims than these&mdash;that to have an individual at the head of
the government who is merely the name through which other persons act,
and who is not amenable to any laws, while the real actors are
personally responsible for what they do in his name, is an expedient
arrangement. That it is very convenient to have some fixed criterion
such as the hereditary principle, which shall obviate the trouble and
danger of a competition for this elevated station. But that these are
all recommendations on the ground of expediency, which may be outweighed
by others, and the misconduct of a weak or tyrannical prince will
justify an alteration in that arrangement, which convenience only, and
the avoidance of occasions for turbulence and anarchy, have sanctioned.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that in the edition of these essays which he
directed to be published after his death, many of those passages which
bear a democratic tendency are suppressed. Such was the fate of the
passage in "The Liberty of the Press" quoted above, and of the remarks
put within brackets in the quotation which follows, from the essay on
"The Parties of Great Britain."</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p><!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_141" id="Page_v1_141">[141]</a></span>Some who will not venture to assert, that the real difference
between Whig and Tory, was lost at the Revolution, seem
inclined to think that the difference is now abolished, and
that affairs are so far returned to their natural state, that
there are at present no other parties amongst us but court and
country; that is, men who, by interest or principle, are
attached either to monarchy or to liberty. It must indeed be
confessed, that the Tory party has of late decayed much in
their numbers, still more in their zeal, and I may venture to
say, still more in their credit and authority. [There is no
man of knowledge or learning, who would not be ashamed to be
thought of that party; and in almost all companies, the name
of <em>Old Whig</em> is mentioned as an incontestible appellation of
honour and dignity. Accordingly, the enemies of the ministry,
as a reproach, call the courtiers the true <em>Tories</em>; and, as
an honour, denominate the gentlemen in the <em>Opposition</em> the
true <em>Whigs</em>.] The Tories have been so long obliged to talk in
the republican style, that they seem to have made converts of
themselves by their hypocrisy, and to have embraced the
sentiments as well as language of their adversaries. There
are, however, very considerable remains of that party in
England, with all their old prejudices; and a proof that court
and country are not our only parties, is, that almost all our
dissenters side with the court, and the lower clergy, at least
of the Church of England, with the opposition. This may
convince us that some bias still hangs upon our constitution,
some extrinsic weight which turns it from its natural course,
and causes a confusion in our parties.<a name="FNanchor_141:1_68" id="FNanchor_141:1_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_141:1_68" class="fnanchor">[141:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most ambitious of the essays, and those on which the author
bestowed most of his skill and attention, are "The Epicurean," "The
Stoic," "The Sceptic," and "The Platonist." These are productions of the
imagination, suggested apparently by the style and method of <cite>The
Spectator</cite>. There is no attempt either to support or to attack the
systems <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_142" id="Page_v1_142">[142]</a></span>represented by the names of the essays, nor is there a
description or definition of them; but on each occasion a member of one
of these celebrated schools speaks in his own person, and describes the
nature of the satisfaction that he finds in his own code of philosophy,
as a solution of the great difficulty of the right rule of thought and
action. "The Epicurean" takes a flight of imagination beyond that of
Hume's other works. It departs from the cold atmosphere of philosophy,
and desires to fascinate as well as enlighten. But though it possesses
all the marks of a fine intellect, the reader is apt to feel how far
more sweetly and gracefully the subject would have been handled by
Addison, to whose department of literature it seems rightly to belong.
The follower of Epicurus is not represented, as indulging in that gross
licentiousness, as wallowing in that disgusting "stye" which the
representations of Diogenes Laertius, and others, have impressed on the
vulgar associations with the name of that master. On the other hand, the
picture is far from embodying what many maintain to be the fundamental
precept of Epicurus, that happiness being the great end sought by man,
the proper method of reaching it is by the just regulation of the
passions and propensities; a precept embodied in the</p>

<div class="bqnormal" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p>"Sperne voluptates. Nocet empta dolere voluptas."</p>
</div>

<p>Hume, who was not correcting errors, or instructing his readers in the
true meaning of terms, or appreciation of characters, draws in "The
Epicurean" a picture of one who is not gross or grovelling in his
pleasures, and who restrains himself lest he should outrun enjoyment;
but whose ruling principle is still that of the voluptuary.</p>

<p>The reader expects to find an attempt to draw his own picture in "The
Sceptic;" but it is not to be found there. <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_143" id="Page_v1_143">[143]</a></span>The sceptic of the essays is
not a man analyzing the principles of knowledge, to find wherein they
consist, but one who is dissatisfied with rules of morality, and who,
examining the current codes one after another, tosses them aside as
unsatisfactory. It is into "The Stoic" that the writer has thrown most
of his heart and sympathy; and it is in that sketch that, though
probably without intention, some of the features of his own character
are portrayed. There are passages which have considerable unison of tone
with those autobiographical documents already quoted, in which he
describes himself as having laboured to subdue the rebellious passions,
to reduce the mind to a regulated system, to drive from it the influence
of petty impressions,&mdash;to hold one great object of life in view, and to
sacrifice before that object whatever stood in the way of his firmly
settled purpose.</p>

<p>Of the success of these essays, and the method in which he occupied
himself after their publication, he thus speaks in his "own life:"&mdash;"The
work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former
disappointment. I continued with my mother and brother in the country,
and in that time recovered the knowledge of the Greek language, which I
had too much neglected in my early youth." On 13th June, 1742, he says
to Henry Home:&mdash;"The <cite>Essays</cite> are all sold in London, as I am informed
by two letters from English gentlemen of my acquaintance. There is a
demand for them; and, as one of them tells me, Innys, the great
bookseller in Paul's Churchyard, wonders there is not a new edition, for
that he cannot find copies for his customers. I am also told that Dr.
Butler has every where recommended them; so that I hope they will have
some success. They may prove like dung with marl, and <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_144" id="Page_v1_144">[144]</a></span>bring forward the
rest of my Philosophy, which is of a more durable, though of a harder
and more stubborn nature. You see I can talk to you in your own style."
In consequence of this favourable reception, a second edition appeared
in 1742.</p>

<p>The communication of which the above is a part, contains the following
short essay on the Orations of Cicero:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>I agree with you, that Cicero's reasonings in his "Orations"
are very often loose, and what we should think to be wandering
from the point; insomuch, that now-a-days a lawyer, who should
give himself such liberties, would be in danger of meeting
with a reprimand from the judge, or at least of being
admonished of the point in question. His Orations against
Verres, however, are an exception; though that plunderer was
so impudent and open in his robberies, that there is the less
merit in his conviction and condemnation. However, these
orations have all a very great merit. The Oration for Milo is
commonly esteemed Cicero's masterpiece, and indeed is, in many
respects, very beautiful; but there are some points in the
reasoning of it that surprise me. The true story of the death
of Clodius, as we learn from the Roman historians, was
this:&mdash;It was only a casual rencontre betwixt Milo and him;
and the squabble was begun by their servants, as they passed
each other on the road. Many of Clodius's servants were
killed, the rest dispersed, and himself wounded, and obliged
to hide himself in some neighbouring shops; from whence he was
dragged out by Milo's orders, and killed in the street. These
circumstances must have been largely insisted on by the
prosecutors, and must have been proved too, since they have
been received as truth by all antiquity. But not a word of
them in Cicero, whose oration only labours to prove two
points, that Milo did not waylay Clodius, and that Clodius was
a bad citizen, and it was meritorious to kill him. If you read
his oration, you'll agree with me. I believe that he has
scarce spoke any thing to the question, as it would now be
conceived, by a court of judicature.</p>

<p>The Orations for Marcellus and Ligarius, as also that for
<!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_145" id="Page_v1_145">[145]</a></span>Archias, are very fine, and chiefly because the subjects do
not require or admit of close reasoning.</p>

<p>'Tis worth your while to read the conclusion of the Oration
for Plancius, where I think the passions are very well
touched. There are many noble passages in the Oration for
Muræna, though 'tis certain that the prosecutors (who,
however, were Servius Sulpicius, and Cato,) must either have
said nothing to the purpose, or Cicero has said nothing. There
is some of that oration lost.</p>

<p>'Twould be a pleasure to read and compare the two first
philippics, that you may judge of the manners of those times,
compared to modern manners. When Cicero spoke the first
philippic, Antony and he had not broke all measures with each
other, but there were still some remains of a very great
intimacy and friendship betwixt them; and besides, Cicero
lived in close correspondence with all the rest of Cæsar's
captains; Dolabella had been his son-in-law; Hirtius and Pansa
were his pupils; Trebasius was entirely his creature. For this
reason, prudence laid him under great restraints at that time
in his declamations against Antony; there is great elegance
and delicacy in them; and many of the thoughts are very fine,
particularly where he mentions his meeting Brutus, who had
been obliged to leave Rome. "I was ashamed," says he, "that I
durst return to Rome after Brutus had left it, and that I
could be in safety where he could not." In short, the whole
oration is of such a strain, that the Duke of Argyle might
have spoke it in the House of Peers against my Lord Orford;
and decency would not allow the greatest enemies to go
farther. But this oration is not much admired by the ancients.
The <cite>Divine Philippic</cite>, as Juvenal calls it, is the second,
where he gives a full loose to his scurrility; and without
having any point to gain by it, except vilifying his
antagonist, and without supporting any fact by witnesses (for
there was no trial or accusation) he rakes into all the filth
of Antony's character; reproaches him with drunkenness and
vomiting, and cowardice, and every sort of debauchery and
villany. There is great genius and wit in many passages of
this oration; but I think the whole turn of it would not now
be generally admired.<a name="FNanchor_145:1_69" id="FNanchor_145:1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_145:1_69" class="fnanchor">[145:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_146" id="Page_v1_146">[146]</a></span>In 1742, Hutcheson published his celebrated outline of a system of
ethics, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Philosophiæ Moralis Institutio Compendiaria</span>." The following
letter contains Hume's remarks on the work; and to render them more
intelligible, the passages he had particularly in view are printed in
notes. It is not, however, as pieces of detached criticism, so much as
in the character of an elucidation of those features of his own system
in which it differs from that of Hutcheson, that the letter is valuable.
It is an argument for the utilitarian system of morality&mdash;an argument
that there is no <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i> which should be the object of moral
conduct, apart from the good of the human species.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Francis Hutcheson</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I received your very agreeable present, for which
I esteem myself much obliged to you. I think it needless to
express to you my esteem of the performance, because both the
solidity of your judgment, and the general approbation your
writings meet with, instruct you sufficiently what opinion you
ought to form of them. Though your good nature might prompt
you to encourage me by some praises, the same reason has not
place with me, however justice might require them of me. Will
not this prove that justice and good nature are not the same?
I am surprised you should have been so diffident about your
Latin. I have not wrote any in that language these many years,
and cannot pretend to judge of particular words and phrases.
But the turn of the whole seems to me very pure, and even easy
and elegant.</p>

<p>"I have subjoined a few reflections, which occurred to me in
reading over the book. By these I pretend <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_147" id="Page_v1_147">[147]</a></span>only to show you
how much I thought myself obliged to you for the pains you
took with me in a like case, and how willing I am to be
grateful.</p>

mention seem not always to be violent and impetuous, more than
self-love or benevolence. There is a calm ambition, a calm
anger or hatred, which, though calm, may likewise be very
strong, and have the absolute command over the mind. The more
absolute they are, we find them to be commonly the calmer. As
these instincts may be calm without being weak, so self-love
may likewise become impetuous and disturbed, especially where
any great pain or pleasure approaches.</p>

<p>"I fancy, however, this author stretches the matter too far.
It seems arrogant to pretend to genius or magnanimity, which
are the most shining qualities a man can possess. It seems
foppish and frivolous to pretend to bodily accomplishments.
The qualities of the heart lie in a medium; and are neither so
shining as the one, nor so little valued as the other. I
suppose the reason why good nature is not more valued, is its
commonness, which has a vast effect on all our sentiments.
Cruelty and hardness of heart is the most detested of all
vices. I always thought you limited too much your ideas of
virtue; and I find I have this opinion in common with several
that have a very high esteem for your philosophy.</p>

Nature," that our moral sense has an authority distinct from
its force and durableness; and that because we always think it
<em>ought</em> to prevail. But this is nothing but an instinct or
principle, which approves of itself upon reflection, and that
is common to all of them. I am not sure that I have not
mistaken your sense, since you do not prosecute this thought.</p>

penetration than any almost I know, condemn reasonings of

<p>Among the Scottish gentry of Hume's day, there were many men of high
education and accomplishments; and the glimpses we occasionally obtain
into the society which he frequented, show us a circle possessing a much
less provincial tone than later times would probably <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_151" id="Page_v1_151">[151]</a></span>have exhibited in
the same class. The notion that a university was a seat of learning,
where the scholarship of all the world should meet, and not a provincial
school, still lingered in our country, and prompted the gentry to
educate their sons abroad. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
the registers of the universities of Paris, Bourgès, Bologna, and
Leyden, were crowded with familiar Scottish names, whom we find holding
as great a proportion among the teachers as among the learners; and thus
a Wilson, a Barclay, a Bellenden, a Jack, and many others, whose fame
hardly reached their native country, are conspicuous among the literary
ornaments of the foreign universities. It is perhaps in a great measure
to the lingering continuance of this practice through part of the
eighteenth century, that we may attribute the learning and
accomplishments of the society in Scotland during that period.<a name="FNanchor_151:1_79" id="FNanchor_151:1_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_151:1_79" class="fnanchor">[151:1]</a></p>

<p>"Many are poets who have never penned their inspiration, and perchance
the best." Many also are philosophers who have never either penned their
philosophy, or put it into shape in their own minds. The two operations
of induction and analysis proceed in every human mind with more or less
success; but it is only when literary ambition, or pecuniary necessity,
or the desire to head a system, prompts a man to collect and put into
shape their results, that <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_152" id="Page_v1_152">[152]</a></span>they are given to the world. Instances have
occurred in which they have appeared very nearly in their raw unwrought
form. Thus, Tucker's "Light of Nature" is nothing more than the
reflections of an English country gentleman, collected and strung
together. Paley and Reid used them as if they had themselves gone
through the operation, and put the results into shape; while the late
William Hazlitt was at the pains of writing an abridgment of the book.
It was fortunate for philosophy that these disconnected observations and
thoughts were collected and preserved. And the reflection leads to the
recollection of the quantity of valuable thoughts that any man, who
notices the course of conversation around him, hears produced and
dropped. In after-dinner social intercourse, in general verbal criticism
of books or men, how much of the gold of true philosophy is scattered
away with the dross; lost almost at the moment it is uttered, and
forgotten both by hearer and speaker.</p>

<p>It is interesting to have so much of this valuable matter, as may have
found its way into epistolary correspondence, preserved. The
conversation of Hume's friends we have unfortunately lost, for there was
no Boswell at his elbow. But their letters show how much of scholarship,
and elegant literature, and philosophy slumbered in the minds of the
Scottish gentry of that age; and assure us that in his intercourse with
an Elliot, a Mure, an Edmonstone, an Elibank, a Macdonald, an Oswald,
Hume was exchanging ideas with men not unworthy of literary fellowship
with a mind even so highly cultivated as his own.</p>

<p>William Mure of Caldwell, who was in 1761 made a Baron of the Exchequer
in Scotland, was among those who seem to have earliest secured and
longest <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_153" id="Page_v1_153">[153]</a></span>retained Hume's esteem. The letters which passed between them
are not often dated, but the circumstances under which many of them are
written are attested by internal evidence. The following is one of the
few which do not admit of being thus tested, but its merit is in a vein
of quiet, easy, epistolary humour, rather than in its connexion with the
events of the writer's life.</p>

<p>"I made a pen, dipt it in ink, and set myself down in a
posture of writing, before I had thought of any subject, or
made provision of one single thought, by which I might
entertain you. I trusted to my better genius that he would
supply me in a case of such urgent necessity; but having
thrice scratched my head, and thrice bit my nails, nothing
presented itself, and I threw away my pen in great
indignation. 'O! thou instrument of dulness,' says I, 'doest
thou desert me in my greatest necessity? and, being thyself so
false a friend, hast thou a secret repugnance at expressing my
friendship to the faithful Mure, who knows thee too well ever
to trust to thy caprices, and who never takes thee in his hand
without reluctance. While I, miserable wretch that I am, have
put my chief confidence in thee; and, relinquishing the sword,
the gown, the cassock, and the toilette, have trusted to thee
alone for my fortune and my fame. Begone! avaunt! Return to
the goose from whence thou camest. With her thou wast of some
use, while thou conveyedst her through the etherial regions.
And why, alas! when plucked from her wing, and put into my
hand, doest thou not recognise some similitude betwixt it and
thy native soil, and render me the <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_154" id="Page_v1_154">[154]</a></span>same service, in aiding
the flights of my heavy imagination?'</p>

<p>"Thus accused, the pen erected itself upon its point, placed
itself betwixt my fingers and my thumb, and moved itself to
and fro upon this paper, to inform you of the story, complain
to you of my injustice, and desire your good offices to the
reconciling such ancient friends. But not to speak nonsense
any longer, (by which, however, I am glad I have already
filled a page of paper,) I arrived here about three weeks ago,
am in good health, and very deeply immersed in books and
study. Tell your sister, Miss Betty, (after having made her my
compliments,) that I am as grave as she imagines a philosopher
should be,&mdash;laugh only once a fortnight, sigh tenderly once a
week, but look sullen every moment. In short, none of Ovid's
metamorphoses ever showed so absolute a change from a human
creature into a beast; I mean, from a gallant into a
philosopher.</p>

<p>"I doubt not but you see my Lord Glasgow very often, and
therefore I shall suppose, when I write to one, I pay my
respects to both. At least, I hope he will so far indulge my
laziness. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim.</i></p>

<p>"Did you receive my letter from Glasgow? I hope it did not
displease you. What are your resolutions with regard to that
affair?</p>

<p>"Remember me to your sister, Miss Nancy, to Miss Dunlop, and
to Mr. Leechman. Tell your mother, or sisters, or whoever is
most concerned about the matter, that their cousin, John
Steuart, is in England, and, as 'tis believed, will return
with a great fortune.</p>

<p>"I say not a word of Mr. Hutcheson, for fear you should think
I intend to run the whole circle of my West-country
acquaintance, and to make you a bearer <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_155" id="Page_v1_155">[155]</a></span>of a great many formal
compliments. But I remember you all very kindly, and desire to

<p>The following letter is in reference to Mr. Mure having been chosen
member of Parliament for Renfrewshire as successor to Alexander
Cunningham, on whose death a new writ was moved on 22d November, 1742.
The advice which this letter offers to a young statesman, seems to be
both sagacious and honest.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">William Mure</span> <i>of Caldwell</i>.</p>

<p>"I have wrote to Mr. Oswald<a name="FNanchor_155:2_81" id="FNanchor_155:2_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_155:2_81" class="fnanchor">[155:2]</a> by this post, in order to
promote an intimacy and friendship betwixt you. I exhort you
to persevere in your intention of cultivating a friendship
with him. You cannot possibly find a man of more worth, of a
gentler disposition, or better understanding. There are
infinite advantages attending an intimacy with such persons;
among which this is not the least, as far as I can judge by my
own experience, that I always derive from it an additional
motive to preserve my character for honour and integrity;
because I know that nothing else can preserve their
friendship. Should I give you an exhortation of this kind, you
might think me very impertinent; though really you ought to
ascribe it more to my friendship, than my diffidence. 'Tis
impossible ever to think ourselves secure enough, where our
concern is extremely great; and, though I dare be confident of
your good conduct, as of my own, yet you must also allow me to
be diffident of it, as I should be of my own. When I consider
your disposition to virtue, cultivated by letters, together
with <!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_156" id="Page_v1_156">[156]</a></span>your moderation, I cannot doubt of your steadiness. The
delicacy of the times does not diminish this assurance, but
only dashes it with a few fears, which rise in me without my
approbation, and against my judgment. Let a strict frugality
be the guardian of your virtue; and preserve your frugality by
a close application to business and study. Nothing would so
effectually throw you into the lumber and refuse of the house
as your departure from your engagements at this time; as a
contrary behaviour will secure your own good opinion, and that
of all mankind. These advantages are not too dearly purchased
even by the loss of fortune, but it belongs to your prudence
and frugality to procure them, without paying so dear a
purchase for them. I say no more; and hope you will ascribe
what I have said, not to the pedagogue, or even to the
philosopher, but to the friend. I make profession of being
such with regard to you; and desire you to consider me as such
no longer than I shall appear to be a man of honour. Yours."</p>

<p>Among Hume's friends in early life, we find James Oswald of Dunnikier,
who is mentioned in the foregoing letter&mdash;a name pretty well known in
the political history of Scotland. He was elected member for the
Kirkaldy district of burghs in 1741. He filled successively the
situations of Commissioner of the Navy, Member of the Board of Trade,
Lord of the Treasury, and Treasurer of Ireland. He was well read in the
sources of literary information, and brought to his official duties a
sagacious, practical understanding, which made him infinitely
serviceable to the speculative labours of his two illustrious friends,
Hume and <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_157" id="Page_v1_157">[157]</a></span>Smith. "I know," says Hume, "you are the most industrious and
the most indolent man of my acquaintance; the former in business, the
latter in ceremony."<a name="FNanchor_157:1_83" id="FNanchor_157:1_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:1_83" class="fnanchor">[157:1]</a> We have occasional glimpses of philosophical
rambles, not unmixed with a little conviviality, in which Oswald
sometimes embarked with his speculative friends. "You will remember," he
says, writing to Henry Home in 1742, "how your friend David Hume and
you, used to laugh at a most sublime declamation I one night made, after
a drunken expedition to Cupar, on the impotency of corruption in certain
circumstances; how I maintained, that on certain occasions, men felt, or
seemed to feel, a certain dignity in themselves, which made them disdain
to act on sordid motives: and how I imagined it to be extremely
possible, in such situations, that even the lowest of men might become
superior to the highest temptations."<a name="FNanchor_157:2_84" id="FNanchor_157:2_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:2_84" class="fnanchor">[157:2]</a> The political course which
he afterwards adopted, however, was not precisely of this soaring cast,
but savoured more of the school of practical expedients founded by Sir
Robert Walpole. We shall afterwards have occasion to see his intercourse
with Hume illustrated at greater length.</p>

<p>The following letter to Mure, contains a pretty sagacious division of
the prominent political movements of the day, into those which a
supporter of the court party would advocate, and those which he would
oppose. Hume seems to have had some dread lest the spirit of what was
then termed patriotism, might sway an inexperienced, young, and aspiring
politician into devious paths, inconsistent with the straight road of
duty and devotion to an adopted party. But Mure seems to have been a
sagacious steady-minded man, not likely to be seduced out of the path he
had chosen. <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_158" id="Page_v1_158">[158]</a></span>He was subsequently much relied on by Lord Bute, and rose
to eminence and distinction as a Tory politician. The letter exhibits a
playful practice of talking of his correspondents as his pupils, which
Hume adopted sometimes with those who had least sympathy with his
principles, unless they were clergymen, or otherwise likely to take the
familiarity in bad part.</p>

<p>"I am surprised you should find fault with my letter. For my
part, I esteem it the best I ever wrote. There is neither
barbarism, solecism, equivoque, redundancy, nor transgression
of one single rule of grammar or rhetoric, through the whole.
The words were chosen with an exact propriety to the sense,
and the sense was full of masculine strength and energy. In
short, it comes up fully to the Duke of Buckingham's
description of fine writing,&mdash;<cite>Exact propriety of words and
thought</cite>. This is more than what can be said of most
compositions. But I shall not be redundant in the praise of
brevity, though much might be said on that subject. To
conclude all, I shall venture to affirm, that my last letter
will be equal in bulk to all the orations you shall deliver,
during the two first sessions of parliament. For, let all the
letters of my epistle be regularly divided, they will be found
equivalent to a dozen of <em>No's</em> and as many <em>Ay's</em>. There will
be found a <em>No</em> for the triennial bill, for the pension bill,
for the bill about regulating elections, for the bill of pains
and penalties against Lord Orford, &amp;c. There will also be
found an Ay for the standing army,<a name="FNanchor_158:1_85" id="FNanchor_158:1_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_158:1_85" class="fnanchor">[158:1]</a> for votes of credit,
for the approbation of treaties, &amp;c. As to the last <em>No</em> I
<!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_159" id="Page_v1_159">[159]</a></span>mentioned, with regard to Lord Orford, I beg it of you as a
particular favour. For, having published to all Britain my
sentiments on that affair, it will be thought by all Britain
that I have no influence on you, if your sentiments be not
conformable to mine. Besides, as you are my disciple in
religion and morals, why should you not be so in politics? I
entreat you to get the bill about witches repealed, and to
move for some new bill to secure the Christian religion, by
burning Deists, Socinians, Moralists, and Hutchinsonians.</p>

<p>"I shall be in town about Christmas, where, if I find not Lord
Glasgow, I shall come down early in the spring to the borders
of the Atlantic Ocean, and rejoice the Tritons and sea-gods
with the prospect of Kelburn<a name="FNanchor_159:1_86" id="FNanchor_159:1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:1_86" class="fnanchor">[159:1]</a> in a blaze. For I find,
that is the only way to unnestle his lordship. But I intend to
use the freedom to write to himself on this subject, if you
will tell me how to direct to him. In the meantime do you make
use of all your eloquence and argument to that purpose.</p>

<p>"Make my humble compliments to the ladies, and tell them, I
should endeavour to satisfy them, if they would name the
subject of the essay they desire. For my part, I know not a
better subject than themselves; if it were not, that being
accused of being unintelligible in some of my writings, I
should be extremely in danger of falling into that fault, when
I should treat of a subject so little to be understood as
women. I would, therefore, rather have them assign me the
deiform fund of the soul, the passive unions of nothing with
nothing, or any other of those mystical points, which I would
endeavour to clear up, and render perspicuous to the meanest
readers.</p>

<p>"Allow not Miss Dunlop to forget, that she has a <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_160" id="Page_v1_160">[160]</a></span>humble
servant, who has the misfortune to be divided from her, by the
whole breadth of this island. I know she never forgets her
friends; but, as I dare not pretend to that relation, upon so
short an acquaintance, I must be beholden to your good offices
for preserving me in her memory; because I suspect mightily
that she is apt to forget and overlook those who can aspire no
higher than the relation I first mentioned.</p>

<p>"This, I think, is enough in all conscience. I see you are
tired with my long letter, and begin to yawn. What! can
nothing satisfy you, and must you grumble at every thing? I
hope this is a good prognostic of your being a
patriot."<a name="FNanchor_160:1_87" id="FNanchor_160:1_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_160:1_87" class="fnanchor">[160:1]</a></p>

<p>In the course of these Memoirs there will be many occasions for
exhibiting Hume's acquaintance with some of the most distinguished
clergymen of his time, and the mutual esteem which he and they
entertained towards each other. Among those members of the Presbyterian
church, with whom he appears to have had the most early intercourse, we
find the name of Dr. Leechman, who was his senior by about five years.
They probably got acquainted with each other in the family of the Mures
of Caldwell, where Leechman had been tutor to Hume's friend and
correspondent. Whatever other jealousies or distastes may have occurred
between them, it would be no drawback to their subsequent intimacy, that
Leechman was by his marriage with Miss Balfour, the brother-in-law of
one of Hume's most zealous controversial opponents, Mr. Balfour of
Pilrig. Dr. Leechman was for many years professor of divinity in the
university of Glasgow, of which he afterwards became principal.
<!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_161" id="Page_v1_161">[161]</a></span>His sermons, now little known, stood at one time in formidable rivalry
with those of Blair. He appears to have been a man who united settled
religious principles with a calm conscientious inquiring mind; and the
account which his biographer, the Rev. James Wodrow, gives of his
lectures, is characteristic of one who had too much respect for truth to
hate or contemn any man engaged in purely metaphysical inquiries,
whatever might be the opinions to which they led him. We are told, that
"no dictatorial opinion, no infallible or decisive judgment on any great
controverted point, was ever delivered from that theological chair.
After the point had undergone a full discussion, none of the students
yet knew the particular opinion of this venerable professor, in any
other way than by the superior weight of the arguments which he had
brought under their view; so delicately scrupulous was he to throw any
bias at all upon ingenuous minds, in their inquiries after sacred
truth."<a name="FNanchor_161:1_88" id="FNanchor_161:1_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_161:1_88" class="fnanchor">[161:1]</a></p>

<p>There is a letter by Hume to Baron Mure, containing a criticism on the
composition and substance of a sermon by Dr. Leechman. From the general
tenor of the letter, it would appear that the sermon was placed in
Hume's hands that the author might have the advantage of his suggestions
in preparing a second edition for the press. The criticisms on style and
collocation are careful and minute, but they all indicate blemishes
peculiar to the piece of composition before the critic, and suggest
corresponding improvements; and none of them appear so far to illustrate
any canon of criticism as to be intelligible to a <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_162" id="Page_v1_162">[162]</a></span>reader who has not
the sermon in his hands, in the same state as that in which it was
inspected by Hume. These corrective annotations precede the following
general remarks on the sermon and its subject. There may be seen in
these remarks a desire, which haunts the whole of Hume's writings on
kindred subjects; a desire to call forth argument and evidence in
support of that side from which he himself feels inclined to dissent;
like the unsatisfied feeling of one who would rather find refuge in the
argumentative fortress of some other person, than remain a sceptical
wanderer at his own free will.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">William Mure</span> <i>of Caldwell</i>.</p>

<p>"These are all the minute faults I could observe in the
sermon. Mr. Leechman has a very clear and manly expression;
but, in my humble opinion, he does not consult his ear enough,
nor aim at a style which may be smooth and harmonious, which,
next to perspicuity, is the chief ornament of style; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</i>
Cicero, Quinctilian, Longinus, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. If this sermon were
not a popular discourse, I should also think it might be made
more concise.</p>

<p>"As to the argument, I could wish Mr. Leechman would, in the
second edition, answer this objection both to devotion and
prayer, and indeed to every thing we commonly call religion,
except the practice of morality, and the assent of the
understanding to the proposition <em>that God exists</em>.</p>

<p>"It must be acknowledged, that nature has given us a strong
passion of admiration for whatever is excellent, and of love
and gratitude for whatever is benevolent and beneficial; and
that the Deity possesses these attributes in the highest
perfection: and yet I assert, he is not the natural object of
any passion or <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_163" id="Page_v1_163">[163]</a></span>affection. He is no object either of the
senses or imagination, and very little of the understanding,
without which it is impossible to excite any affection. A
remote ancestor, who has left us estates and honours acquired
with virtue, is a great benefactor; and yet 'tis impossible to
bear him any affection, because unknown to us: though in
general we know him to be a man or a human creature, which
brings him vastly nearer our comprehension than an invisible,
infinite spirit. A man, therefore, may have his heart
perfectly well disposed towards every proper and natural
object of affection&mdash;friends, benefactors, country, children,
&amp;c.&mdash;and yet, from this circumstance of the invisibility and
incomprehensibility of the Deity, may feel no affection
towards him. And, indeed, I am afraid that all enthusiasts
mightily deceive themselves. Hope and fear perhaps agitate
their breast when they think of the Deity; or they degrade him
into a resemblance with themselves, and by that means render
him more comprehensible. Or they exult with vanity in
esteeming themselves his peculiar favourites; or at best they
are actuated by a forced and strained affection, which moves
by starts and bounds, and with a very irregular, disorderly
pace. Such an affection cannot be required of any man as his
duty. Please to observe, that I not only exclude the turbulent
passions, but the calm affections. Neither of them can operate
without the assistance of the senses and imagination; or at
least a more complete knowledge of the object than we have of
the Deity. In most men this is the case; and a natural
infirmity can never be a crime. But, secondly, were devotion
never so much admitted, prayer must still be excluded. First,
the addressing of our virtuous wishes and desires to the
Deity, since the address has no influence on him, is only a
kind of <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_164" id="Page_v1_164">[164]</a></span>rhetorical figure, in order to render these wishes
more ardent and passionate. This is Mr. Leechman's doctrine.
Now, the use of any figure of speech can never be a duty.
Secondly, this figure, like most figures of rhetoric, has an
evident impropriety in it; for we can make use of no
expression, or even thought, in prayers and entreaties, which
does not imply that these prayers have an influence. Thirdly,
this figure is very dangerous, and leads directly, and even
unavoidably, to impiety and blasphemy. 'Tis a natural
infirmity of men to imagine that their prayers have a direct
influence; and this infirmity must be extremely fostered and
encouraged by the constant use of prayer. Thus, all wise men
have excluded the use of images and pictures in prayer, though
they certainly enliven devotion; because 'tis found by
experience, that with the vulgar these visible representations
draw too much towards them, and become the only objects of
devotion."<a name="FNanchor_164:1_89" id="FNanchor_164:1_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_164:1_89" class="fnanchor">[164:1]</a></p>

<p>The literary history of this sermon is curious and instructive. When its
author received his appointment of professor of divinity in 1744, a
party in the church opposed his being admitted in the usual manner as a
member of the presbytery of Glasgow; and one of their methods of attack
was to charge him with heretical opinions, promulgated in this sermon,
of which the first edition had been then published. It is singular
enough, in comparing their charge with Hume's criticism, to find the two
attacks brought against the same point, though with different weapons.
"The purport of the whole went to charge Mr. Leechman with having laid
too little stress on the merit of the satisfaction and intercession of
our blessed Saviour, <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_165" id="Page_v1_165">[165]</a></span>as the sole ground of our acceptance with God in
prayer, and with teaching Christians to look for pardon and acceptance
on other grounds than this."<a name="FNanchor_165:1_90" id="FNanchor_165:1_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_165:1_90" class="fnanchor">[165:1]</a></p>

university of Edinburgh. In 1742, he was appointed physician to the Earl
of Stair, commander of the British troops in the Low Countries; and
through this circumstance it will be seen, from the following letter,
that Hume contemplated a vacancy, and that he was employing the usual
means for securing his own appointment to the chair.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">William Mure</span> <i>of Caldwell</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Will</span>,&mdash;I shall tell you how my affair stands. Dr.
Pringle has been absent two years by allowance, and about six
weeks ago wrote a letter to the provost, in which he seemed in
a manner to have resigned his office; and desired the council,
if they thought the university any way a sufferer by his
absence, to send him over a resignation in form, which he
would sign, and then they might proceed to the choice of a
successor. Mr. Couts,<a name="FNanchor_165:3_92" id="FNanchor_165:3_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_165:3_92" class="fnanchor">[165:3]</a> upon receiving this, mentioned me
to several of the council, and desired me to mention myself as
a <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_166" id="Page_v1_166">[166]</a></span>candidate to all my friends; not with a view of soliciting
or making interest, but in order to get the public voice on my
side, that he might with the more assurance employ his
interest in my behalf. I accordingly did so; and being allowed
to make use of the provost's name, I found presently that I
should have the whole council on my side, and that, indeed, I
should have no antagonist. But when the provost produced the
doctor's letter to the council, he discovered that he had in
secret wrote differently to some of his friends, who still
insisted that the town should give him allowance to be absent
another year. The whole council, however, except two or three,
exclaimed against this proposal, and it appeared evidently,
that if the matter had been put to a vote, there would have
been a majority of ten to one against the doctor. But Mr.
Couts, though his authority be quite absolute in the town, yet
makes it a rule to govern them with the utmost gentleness and
moderation: and this good maxim he sometimes pushes even to an
extreme. For the sake of unanimity, therefore, he agrees to an
expedient, started by one of the doctor's friends, which he
thought would be a compliment to the doctor, and yet would
serve the same purpose as the immediate declaration of a
vacancy in the office. This expedient was to require either
the doctor's resignation, or a declaration upon honour, that
whether it were peace or war, or in any event, he would
against November, 1745, return to his office, and resign his
commission of physician to the army, or any other employment
incompatible with his attendance in this place. This last
condition, Mr. Couts thinks it impossible he will comply with,
because he has a guinea a-day at present, as physician to the
army, along with a good deal of business and half-pay during
life. And there seems <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_167" id="Page_v1_167">[167]</a></span>at present to be small chance for a
peace before the term here assigned. I find, however, that
some are of a contrary opinion; and particularly several of
the doctor's friends say that he will sign the obligation
above-mentioned. We shall receive his answer in a fortnight,
upon which my success seems entirely to depend.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, I have received another offer, which I
shall tell you as a friend, but desire you may not mention to
any body. My Lord Garlees<a name="FNanchor_167:1_93" id="FNanchor_167:1_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:1_93" class="fnanchor">[167:1]</a> received a commission from
Mr. Murray of Broughton<a name="FNanchor_167:2_94" id="FNanchor_167:2_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:2_94" class="fnanchor">[167:2]</a> to look out for a travelling
tutor to his son, who is at present at Glasgow. My lord
inclines to give me the preference, but I could not positively
accept, till I had seen the end of this affair, which is so
near a crisis. Please to inform me of any particulars that you
know with regard to the young man, his family, &amp;c., that in
case the former project fail, I may deliberate upon the other.
The accusation of heresy, deism, scepticism, atheism, &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c., was started against me; but never took, being bore down
by the contrary authority of all the good company in town. But
what surprised me extremely, was to find that this accusation
was supported by the pretended authority of Mr. Hutcheson and
even Mr. Leechman, who, 'tis said, agreed that I was a very
unfit person for such an office. This appears to me absolutely
incredible, especially with regard to the latter gentleman.
For, as to Mr. Hutcheson, all my friends think that he has
<!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_168" id="Page_v1_168">[168]</a></span>been rendering me bad offices to the utmost of his power. And
I know that Mr. Couts, to whom I said rashly that I thought I
could depend upon Mr. Hutcheson's friendship and
recommendation,&mdash;I say, Mr. Couts now speaks of that professor
rather as my enemy than as my friend. What can be the meaning
of this conduct in that celebrated and benevolent moralist, I
cannot imagine. I shall be glad to find, for the honour of
philosophy, that I am mistaken: and, indeed, I hope so too;
and beg of you to inquire a little into the matter, but very
cautiously, lest I make him my open and professed enemy, which
I would willingly avoid. Here then it behoves you to be very
discreet.</p>

<p>"'Tis probable Mr. Murray of Broughton may consult Mr.
Hutcheson and the other professors of Glasgow, before he fix
absolutely on a tutor for his son. We shall then see whether
he really entertains a bad opinion of my orthodoxy, or is only
unwilling that I should be Professor of Ethics in Edinburgh;
lest that town, being in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, should
spread its contagion all around it, and even infect the
students of the latter university.</p>

<p>"I have passed a week with Mr. Oswald at Kirkcaldy. He makes
his compliments to you. He has shown me the whole economy of
the navy, the source of the navy debt, with many other
branches of public business. He seems to have a great genius
for these affairs, and I fancy will go far in that way if he
perseveres."</p>

<p class="datelineit">"Edinburgh, August 4, 1744."<a name="FNanchor_168:1_95" id="FNanchor_168:1_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_168:1_95" class="fnanchor" style="font-style: normal;">[168:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It may easily be imagined that both Mr. Hutcheson and Dr. Leechman would
be opposed to the appointment <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_169" id="Page_v1_169">[169]</a></span>of David Hume as a teacher of moral
philosophy in one of the universities; and that they might entertain
this opinion along with an honest admiration of his character, and an
appreciation of the value of his talents when exercised in another
sphere. It is at all events gratifying to find, that whatever opposition
Hutcheson may have made, he was influenced by no sordid motive, as he
was offered the chair, and refused it. On 27th March, 1745, a letter in
which Dr. Pringle resigned the chair, was read to the Town Council. On
3d April, a nomination to the chair was transmitted to Hutcheson.<a name="FNanchor_169:1_96" id="FNanchor_169:1_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_169:1_96" class="fnanchor">[169:1]</a>
He declined the honour, in a rather verbose letter, in which he speaks
in the tone of one whose tenure of life cannot be expected to be strong
enough to fit him for new labours: yet he was then only fifty years old.
His death occurred two years later, and he probably felt that his long
series of intellectual labours had exhausted too much of the stamina of
life to leave him the prospect of a successful career in a new sphere of
duty. On Hutcheson's letter being read to the council, on 10th April,
1745, the minutes bear, that "several other persons having been named as
proper candidates, it was thereupon moved in council, whether to proceed
to take the ministers' avisamentum betwixt and next council day, in
order to facilitate their choice, or to delay the same for a month or
six weeks, so that the members of council might with the greater leisure
deliberate thereanent; and the rolls having thereupon been called, and
the vote marked, it carried delay for said space."</p>

<p>It is probable that the "ministers' avisamentum," whatever may be
precisely designed by that phrase, <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_170" id="Page_v1_170">[170]</a></span>was not such a recommendation as
would turn the minds of the members of council in favour of Hume. His
name is not mentioned in the council records in connexion with the
proceedings, and the vacancy was filled up on 5th June, 1745, by the
appointment of William Cleghorn, who had acted for Dr. Pringle in his
absence.</p>

<p>The date of these transactions, brings us into the middle of a very
curious episode in Hume's history, which must now be examined.</p>

</div>


<p class="section">Hume's history of his residence with the Marquis of Annandale, is given
in the following brief terms, in his "own life." "In 1745, I received a
letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me to come and live with
him in England: I found, also, that the friends and family of that young
nobleman were desirous of putting him under my care and direction, for
the state of his mind and health required it. I lived with him a
twelvemonth. My appointments during that time made a considerable
accession to my small fortune."</p>

<p>It might have been favourable perhaps to the dignity of his position in
the world of letters, that this episode in his history had never been
more fully <!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_171" id="Page_v1_171">[171]</a></span>narrated; for a philosopher conducting a litigation for £75
of arrears of salary, is apt to experience that diminution of respect in
the eyes of the public, which the prince of Condé discovered that a hero
suffered in those of his valet. Since, however, many statements have
been given to the world, connected with that part of Hume's life, and
many charges and countercharges among the persons connected with it are
preserved, it is necessary to give such a brief view of the whole
affair, as may enable the reader to estimate the respective merits of
the parties in the dispute. A collection of documents on the subject was
lately published by a gentleman to whom the literary history of Scotland
is indebted for many other services;<a name="FNanchor_171:1_97" id="FNanchor_171:1_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_171:1_97" class="fnanchor">[171:1]</a> and from his book the
following statement is compiled.</p>

<p>The person with whom David Hume was thus connected was the last Marquis
of Annandale, on whose death that title became dormant. On the 5th of
March, 1748, he was found, on an inquest from the Court of Chancery in
England, to be a lunatic, incapable of governing himself and managing
his own affairs, and to have been so since 12th December, 1744, a few
months anterior to Hume's engagement with him. The correspondence does
not give the <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_172" id="Page_v1_172">[172]</a></span>reader the notion of one reduced to so abject a mental
state, but rather that of a man nervously timid and reserved;
distrustful of himself and his ability to transact business with other
people, but not quite incapable of managing his affairs, though
exciteable, and liable to be driven into fits of passion by causes not
susceptible of being anticipated. A party to the correspondence, talking
of him as in an improved condition, says: "My Lord walked out with me
lately two or three miles, received and returned the compliments of the
hat of those we met, and without any shyness or reserve: and bears to
stand by, and hear me talk with any farmer or countryman. This is a vast
change for the better, and the greatest appearance that it will

literary ambition. Hume says in a letter to Lord Elibank, "I have copied
out half a dozen of epigrams, which I hope will give you entertainment.
The thought in them is indeed little inferior to that in the celebrated
Epigrams of Rousseau; though the versification be not so correct. What a
pity! I say this on account both of the author and myself; for I am
afraid I must leave him." And on another occasion he alludes at length
<!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_173" id="Page_v1_173">[173]</a></span>to a far more extensive literary achievement, a novel, which the
excited Marquis had written, and which those about him had found it
necessary to print, circulating a few copies, and advertising it in one
newspaper to allay any suspicions in the author's mind that a thousand
copies had not been printed. Hume says:</p>

<p>"You would certainly be a little surprised and vexed on receiving a
printed copy of the novel, which was in hands when you left London. If I
did not explain the mystery to you, I believe I told you, that I hoped
that affair was entirely over, by my employing Lord Marchmont and Lord
Bolingbroke's authority against publishing that novel; though you will
readily suppose that neither of these two noble Lords ever perused it.
This machine operated for six weeks; but the vanity of the author
returned with redoubled force, fortified by suspicions, and increased by
the delay. '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pardie,' dit il, 'je crois que ces messieurs veulent être
les seules Seigneurs d'Angleterre qui eussent de l'esprit. Mais je leur
montrerai ce que le petit A&mdash;&mdash; peut faire aussi.</span>' In short, we were
obliged to print off thirty copies, to make him believe that we had
printed a thousand, and that they were to be dispersed all over the
kingdom.</p>

<p>"My Lady Marchioness will also receive a copy, and I am afraid it may
give her a good deal of uneasiness, by reason of the story alluded to in
the novel, and which she may imagine my Lord is resolved to bring to
execution. Be so good, therefore, as to inform her, that I hope this
affair is all over. I discovered, about a fortnight ago, that one of the
papers sent to that damsel had been sent back by her under cover to his
rival, Mr. M'&mdash;&mdash;, and that she had plainly, by that step, sacrificed
him to her other lover. This was real matter of fact, and I had the
<!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_174" id="Page_v1_174">[174]</a></span>good fortune to convince him of it; so that his pride seems to have got
the better of his passion, and he never talks of her at present."</p>

<p>The "novel" appears to have referred to some little event in its
author's private history. If there be a copy of it now any where
existing, it is to be feared that it wastes its fragrance on the desert
air, as the existence of so choice a flower of literature, were it in
the possession of any collector, could not fail to have been rumoured
through the bibliographical world.</p>

<p>The Marquis had previously been attended by a succession of hired
companions, of whom one was a man of considerable distinction, Colonel
James Forrester,<a name="FNanchor_174:1_99" id="FNanchor_174:1_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_174:1_99" class="fnanchor">[174:1]</a> a person who, in the Scottish society of the
age, seems to have united some of the qualities of a Chesterfield to a
like proportion of those of a Beau <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_175" id="Page_v1_175">[175]</a></span>Fielding. He was the author of "The
Polite Philosopher;" a lively little essay, sometimes published along
with Chesterfield's "Advice," in which the author is so much at ease
with his reader, that he discourses in prose or poetry as his own humour
dictates. Johnson said, with reference to the man and the book, that "he
was himself the great polite he drew;" and if it did not happen that his
coxcombry excited the poor invalid's irritable nerves to distraction, he
was probably an infinitely more suitable man for the office of companion
to the Marquis of Annandale, than David Hume.</p>

<p>The overtures to Hume were made by the Marquis himself; who was,
according to an expression used by Sir James Johnstone, when writing to
Hume, "charmed with something contained in his Essays." The place of
residence of the Marquis was Weldhall, near St. Alban's, in
Hertfordshire. Hume had to go to London to make the anticipatory
arrangements, and he commenced his companionship on 1st April, 1745. The
insurrection, headed by Prince Charles Edward in Scotland, commenced
four months <!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_176" id="Page_v1_176">[176]</a></span>afterwards; and there is perhaps nothing more curious in
the whole dispute than the indifference with which this matter, fraught
with so much importance to his countrymen, is spoken of by Hume; while
there could not probably be a better answer to those who afterwards
insinuated that he was a Jacobite, than an account of the manner in
which his thoughts were occupied during that struggle. He occasionally
complains that he is prevented from personally discussing, with the
individuals interested, the matters he is writing about, on account of
"the present unhappy troubles;" and the following portion of a letter to
Sir James Johnstone of Westerhall, the brother of the Marquis's
stepfather, written immediately after he had left his attendance on the
Marquis, is the only occasion in which he appears to show the least
sympathy in the conflict or its results.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Portsmouth, June 6, 1746.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have always sympathized very cordially with you,
whenever I met with any of the names, wherein you was
interested, in any of the public papers; but I hope that one
of the persons is now safe by his escape, and the other
protected by her sex and innocence.<a name="FNanchor_176:1_100" id="FNanchor_176:1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_176:1_100" class="fnanchor">[176:1]</a> We live not now in
a time, when public crimes are supposed to cancel all private
ties, or when the duties of relation, even though executed
beyond the usual bounds, will render the <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_177" id="Page_v1_177">[177]</a></span>persons criminal. I
am willing, therefore, to flatter myself, that your anxiety
must now be in a great measure over, and that a more happy
conclusion of so calamitous an affair could not be expected,
either for private individuals or for the public. Some little
time ago, we had here a conversation with regard to L&mdash;&mdash;, and
other persons in her condition, when General St. Clair said,
that he heard, from some of the ministers, that the intentions
of the menaces, or even of the intended prosecutions (if they
went so far,) were not to proceed to execution; but only to
teach our countrywomen (many of whom had gone beyond all
bounds) that their sex was no absolute protection to them, and
that they were equally exposed to the law with the other sex.
However, I doubt not but your friend has no occasion for their
clemency, whatever may be the case with the other ladies in
the same situation, who had particularly valued themselves
upon their activity and courage."</p>
</div>


<p>It is now necessary to enter on a subject, which one feels a natural
inclination to postpone, as long as the order of events will afford any
excuse for looking at other things: the treatment Hume experienced in
this his self-adopted slavery. He had to deal with a capricious
unreasonable employer; to that he would, in the circumstances,
philosophically reconcile himself. He states in one of his letters, that
he lived with him "in a more equal way of complaisance and good humour
than could well have been expected. Some little disgusts and humours
could not be prevented, and never were proposed to be of any
consequence." But he had another and a far more unpleasant person to
deal with, in a certain Philip Vincent, a captain <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_178" id="Page_v1_178">[178]</a></span>in the navy,<a name="FNanchor_178:1_101" id="FNanchor_178:1_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:1_101" class="fnanchor">[178:1]</a> a
relation of the Dowager-marchioness of Annandale. For some months
matters appear to have gone smoothly with all concerned. The following
letter to one of his esteemed friends, shows that Hume was consoling
himself for the probable dissipation of his hopes of a professorship, by
reflecting on his good fortune in being connected with so amiable and
excellent a man as Captain Vincent:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am informed that such a popular clamour has
been raised against me in Edinburgh, on account of scepticism,
heterodoxy, and other hard names, which confound the ignorant,
that my friends find some difficulty, in working out the point
of my professorship, which once appeared so easy. Did I need a
testimonial for my orthodoxy, I should certainly appeal to
you; for you know that I always imitated Job's friends, and
defended the cause of Providence when [you] attacked it, on
account of the headachs you felt after a deba[uch.] But, as a
more particular explication of that particular seems superfluous,
I shall only apply to you for a renewal of <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_179" id="Page_v1_179">[179]</a></span>your good offices
with your nephew, Lord Tinwal,<a name="FNanchor_179:1_103" id="FNanchor_179:1_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:1_103" class="fnanchor">[179:1]</a> whose interest with
Yetts and Allan may be of service to me. There is no time to
lose; so that I must beg you to be speedy in writing to him, or
speaking to him on that head. A word to the wise. Even that is
not necessary to a friend, such as I have always esteemed and
found you to be.</p>

<p>"I live here very comfortably with the Marquis of Annandale,
who, I suppose you have heard, sent me a letter of invitation,
along with a bill of one hundred pounds, about two months ago.
Every thing is much better than I expected, from the accounts
I heard after I came to London; for the secrecy with which I
stole away from Edinburgh, and which I thought necessary for
preserving my interest there, kept me entirely ignorant of his
situation.</p>

<p>"My lord never was in so good a way [before.] He has a regular
family, honest servants, and every thing is managed genteelly
and with economy. He has intrusted all his English affairs to
a mighty honest friendly man, Captain Vincent, who is
cousin-german to the Marchioness. And as my lord has now taken
so strong a turn to solitude and repose, as he formerly had to
company and agitation, 'tis to be hoped that his good parts
and excellent dispositions may at last, being accompanied with
more health and tranquillity, render him a comfort to his
friends, if not an ornament <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_180" id="Page_v1_180">[180]</a></span>to his country. As you live in
the neighbourhood of the Marchioness, it may give her a
pleasure to hear these particulars. I am,<a name="FNanchor_180:1_104" id="FNanchor_180:1_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_180:1_104" class="fnanchor">[180:1]</a> &amp;c.</p>

<p class="datelineit">"Weldehall, near St. Albans,<br />
<span style="padding-left: 1.5em;">"April 25, 1745.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, we find Captain Vincent, when he speaks of Hume,
saying, "I think it very happy that he is with my lord, and still more
so if he is constantly to remain with him, which I do not foresee but
that he may; and I must do him the justice to say, that after having had
time enough to weigh the temper, situation, and circumstances of the
person he has to deal with, he very candidly owned that it was what he
could cheerfully abide with." And again in August, "Mr. Hume is almost
wholly taken up with our friend personally, so that he can scarce have
the resource of amusement, or even of business, which is somewhat hard
upon a man of erudition and letters, whom indeed I think very deserving
and good natured; and whilst he can be his companion, there could not be
a better made choice of." The captain, in other letters, speaks of Hume
as "a very worthy and knowing man," and as "My friend Mr. Hume;" and
seems at one time to have wished that an annuity of £100 a-year should
be settled upon him, without reference to his continuance in his office,
and in addition to the salary he might receive while he did so. But the
dawn was soon afterwards overcast.</p>

<p>Hume, in the first place, disliked some of Captain Vincent's proposed
arrangements, as to the disposal <!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_181" id="Page_v1_181">[181]</a></span>of the person of the Marquis, and
seems to have soon suspected him of wishing to carry through designs
which would materially affect the interest of some of the Marquis's
relations. It is probable that a feeling of friendliness, or of duty,
may have prompted him to interfere. It may be so, and he may in reality
have done good; but the impression produced by the correspondence is,
regret that Hume did not at once retire in lofty scorn from the scene of
these paltry cabals.</p>

<p>Captain Vincent held a commission from the Marquis to "hire and dismiss
servants," and perform other like functions. It was in virtue of this
authority that he dealt with Hume; and he seems at first to have
thought, that in the person of the philosopher he had met with a sort of
superior and valuable member of the fraternity of upper-servants. Though
Hume had then written the works on which a large portion of his European
reputation was afterwards built, this man seems to have regarded his
literary abilities as merely an enhancement of the qualities which
suited him for his servile office. Looking upon himself as a member of
the family, he appears to have had much the same disposition to admit
that Hume's literary distinction put them on a par with each other, as
he might have had to admit that the display of an unexpected degree of
musical talent in the servants' hall would qualify one of its
frequenters to be hail-fellow well met with him in the dining-room.
Whether Hume was right or wrong in the suspicions he entertained of
Vincent, the conduct of Vincent to Hume was brutal, and that on his own
showing.</p>

<p>One of Hume's views, as to the proper treatment of the Marquis, was,
that the isolation of Weldhall was unsuitable to his condition: that he
should be in a <!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_182" id="Page_v1_182">[182]</a></span>a more cheerful residence, and one in other respects
more suitable; and the dispute appears to have been for some time
suspended on this peg. On the 31st October, Hume writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the mighty matter in dispute? Only about hiring a few carts to
remove the family to another house, in order to quit this; which, for
very good reasons, is infinitely disagreeable to your friend, very
dangerous, will be uninhabitable for cold during the winter season, and
costs £300 to £400 a-year, at least, to the family, more than is
requisite." And afterwards he says of Vincent:&mdash;"He said, when he was
here, that we shall live in this house till the lease was out, in spite
of all opposition."</p>

<p>In the letter from which the preceding passage is taken, he says to Sir
James Johnstone,&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I must begin by complaining of you for having yoked me here
with a man of the Captain's character, without giving me the
least hint concerning it, if it was known to you, as, indeed,
it is no secret to the world. You seemed satisfied with his
conduct, and even praised him to me; which I am fully
persuaded was the effect of your caution, not your conviction.
However, I, who was altogether a stranger, entered into the
family with so gross a prepossession. I found a man who took
an infinite deal of pains for another, with the utmost
professions both of disinterestedness and friendship to him
and me; and I readily concluded that such a one must be either
one of the best, or one of the worst of men. I can easily
excuse myself for having judged at first on the favourable
side; and must confess that, when light first began to break
in upon me, I resisted it as I would a <!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_183" id="Page_v1_183">[183]</a></span>temptation of the
devil. I thought it, however, proper to keep my eyes open for
farther observation; till the strangest and most palpable
facts, which I shall inform you of at meeting, put the matter
out of all doubt to me.</p>

<p>"There is nothing he would be fonder of than to sow dissension
betwixt my Lady and you, whom he hates and fears. He flatters,
and caresses, and praises, and hates me also; and would be
glad to chase me away, as doing me the honour, and, I hope,
the justice of thinking me a person very unfit for his
purposes. As he wants all manner of pretext from my conduct
and behaviour, he has broken his word."</p>
</div>


<p>That these statements are not those of a secret foe emitting calumnies
in the dark, is made clear by the concluding terms of the letter, in
which the writer, instead of asking his correspondent to keep its
contents secret&mdash;a very common clause when people, thrown much in each
other's way, write about each other's conduct to third parties&mdash;says, "I
wish you would bring this letter south with you, that, if you will allow
it, I may show it to him,"&mdash;that is, to Vincent.</p>

<p>The excitement communicated to Hume's nerves on this occasion, is shown
by the following short letter to Sir James, so much at variance with the
usual character of his writings:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"God forgive you, dear Sir, God forgive you, for neither
coming to us, nor writing to us. The unaccountable, and, I may
say, the inhuman treatment we meet with here, throws your
friend into rage and fury, and me into the greatest
melancholy. My only comfort is when I think of your arrival;
but still I know not when I can propose to myself that
satisfaction. I flatter myself you have received two short
<!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_184" id="Page_v1_184">[184]</a></span>letters I wrote within this month; though the uncertainty of
the post gives me apprehension. I must again entreat you to
favour me with a short line, to let me know the time you can
propose to be with us; for, if it be near, I shall wait with
patience and with pleasure; if distant, I shall write you at
length, that you and my Lady Marchioness may judge of our
circumstances and situation.&mdash;I am, Dear Sir, yours, with
great sincerity,</p>

<p class="author">D. H."</p>
</div>


<p>Unfortunately, the precise objects which the parties respectively
desired to accomplish cannot be distinctly ascertained, as the letters
generally refer to explanations which it will be necessary for the
parties to make when they meet, because the troubled character of the
times made private letters liable to be opened and inspected. Hume at
the same time, being in the midst of a considerable retinue of servants
under the control and management of his enemy, was in dread that spies
were set on his motions. Thus he says to Sir James Johnstone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I did write you the very first occasion after I came out thither. But I
find my letters have great difficulty to reach you; for which reason I
shall put this into the post-house myself, to prevent such practices as
I suspect are used in this family. I have some reason also to think that
spies are placed upon my most indifferent actions. I told you that I had
had more conversation with one of the servants than was natural, and for
what reason. Perhaps this fellow had the same privilege granted him as
other spies, to rail against his employer, in order to draw in an
unguarded man to be still more unguarded. But such practices, if real,
(for I am not altogether certain,) can only turn to the confusion of
those who use them. <!-- Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_185" id="Page_v1_185">[185]</a></span>Where there is no arbitrary power, innocence must
be safe; and if there be arbitrary power in this family, 'tis long since
I knew I could not remain in it. What a scene is this for a man
nourished in philosophy and polite letters to enter into, all of a
sudden, and unprepared! But I can laugh, whatever happens; and the
newness of such practices rather diverts me. At first they caused
indignation and hatred; and even (though I am ashamed to confess it)
melancholy and sorrow."</p>

<p>What a scene indeed!</p>

<p>The chief incidental light that can be thrown on the nature of the
suspicions which Hume entertained of Vincent, is derived from the
position of the person to whom the greater part of these letters were
addressed&mdash;Sir James Johnstone, who has already been alluded to as a
connexion of the Annandale family. His brother, Colonel John Johnstone,
had married the Marchioness-dowager, the mother of the Marquis, and by
her had three children. She was an heiress; and though the Scottish
estates, following an entail, were destined to pass to another family,
her own property would be inherited by the children of her second
marriage, on the death of the Marquis. The accumulated rents of his
estates, being movable property, would also be the subject of
succession, different from that of the entail; and therefore the
management of this property, during his imbecility, was a matter of much
moment to some of his connexions. The public had ample opportunity of
knowing the extent of these accumulated funds. They rose to the sum of
£415,000, and were the subject of long litigation both in England and
Scotland. The "Annandale cases" had a material effect in settling in
Britain the important principle which had been previously adopted over
the greater part of Europe, that the movable or <!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_186" id="Page_v1_186">[186]</a></span>personal estate of a
deceased person must be distributed according to the law of the country
where he had his domicile or permanent residence at the time of his
death.</p>

<p>It is pretty evident that Vincent had certain family projects in view in
connexion with the management of the estate, and that Hume wished to
defeat them. Before the outbreak of the quarrel, the latter had written
to Sir James:</p>

<p>"I shall endeavour to give you my opinion, which I am certain would be
yours, were you to pass a day amongst us. I am sorry, therefore, to
inform you, that nothing now remains but to take care of your friend's
person, in the most decent and convenient manner; and, with regard to
his fortune, to be attentive that the great superplus, which will remain
after providing for these purposes, should be employed by my Lady and
your nephews, as the true proprietors, for their honour and advantage."</p>

<p>Having written a civil letter to Vincent, stating that he desired the
intervention of Sir James Johnstone, and that he believed, in the mean
time, that the Marquis was satisfied with the engagement, and did not
wish him to be dismissed, he thus hints to Sir James his suspicions of
Vincent's views.</p>

<p>"I must own it was with excessive reluctance I wrote so softening and
obliging a letter to this man; but as I knew that such a method of
proceeding was conformable to your intentions, I thought it my duty to
comply. However, I easily saw it would all be vain, and would only
fortify him in his arrogance. Do you think that <em>the absolute possession
of so ample a fortune</em>, to which this is the first requisite step, is a
prize to be resigned for a few fair words or flattering <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_187" id="Page_v1_187">[187]</a></span>professions? He
deals too much in that bait himself ever to be caught with it by others.</p>

<p>"I think this is the last opportunity that will ever offer of retrieving
the family and yourself (as far as you are concerned with the family,)
from falling into absolute slavery to so odious a master. If, in the
beginning, and while he is watched by jealous eyes, he can attempt such
things, what will he not do when he has fixed his authority, and has no
longer any inspector over him?</p>

<p>"'Tis lucky, therefore, that this, as it seems the last, is so good an
opportunity. Nothing was ever so barefaced as his conduct. To quarrel
with me, merely because I civilly supported a most reasonable project;
to threaten me with his vengeance, if I opened my lips to you concerning
your friend's affairs; to execute that threat, without a pretext, or
without consulting you; these steps give us such advantages over him as
must not be neglected.</p>

<p>"I hope you will not take it amiss, if I say, that your conduct, with
regard to your friend, and to those who have at different times been
about him, has all along been too gentle and cautious. I had
considerably shaken the authority of this man (though I had no authority
myself,) merely by my firmness and resolution. He now assumes more, when
he observes your precautions.</p>

<p>"But, as I do not believe that, though your firmness may daunt him, it
will ever engage him to loose hold of so fine a prize, it will be
requisite to think of more effectual remedies. Happily there is time
enough both to contrive and to execute. For, though he makes me the
offer of present payment, (which I hope you observed,) in order to
engage me to leave you presently, he shall not get rid of me so easily."</p>

<p>Hume appears, with a marvellous degree of <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_188" id="Page_v1_188">[188]</a></span>self-restraint&mdash;marvellous in
a man of independent spirit&mdash;to have felt that it was his duty not to be
driven from his post by the insults of Vincent. He says to Sir James
Johnstone, when apparently wearied out, "I fancy he must prevail at
last; and I shall take care not to be a bone of contention betwixt you,
unless you think I am the most advantageous piece of ground on which you
can resist him." His opinion, that the interests of the other relations
were concerned in his resisting Vincent's designs, is confirmed by the
following letter, also addressed to Sir James Johnstone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He [Vincent] desired you should intermeddle as little as possible in
these affairs; adding, that he intended, by keeping my Lord's person and
his English affairs in his own hands, to free my Lady from all slavery
to you.</p>

<p>"Ever since, no entreaties, no threatenings have been spared to make me
keep silence to you; to which my constant answer was, that I thought not
that consistent with my duty. I told him freely, that I would lay all
the foregoing reasons before you, when you came to London, and hoped you
would prevail with him to alter his opinion. If not, we should all
write, if you thought proper, to my Lady Marchioness, in order to have
her determination. The endeavouring, then, to make me keep silence to
you, was also to keep my Lady in the dark about such material points,
since I could not have access to let her know the situation of our
affairs, by any other means.</p>

<p>"He offered to let me leave your friend in the beginning of winter, if I
pleased, provided I would make no opposition to his plan,&mdash;that is,
would not inform you; for I was not capable of making any other
opposition. He added, he would allow me my <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_189" id="Page_v1_189">[189]</a></span>salary for the whole year,
and that he would himself supply my place, leave his house in London,
and live with your friend. Can all this pains be taken, merely for the
difference betwixt one house and another?</p>

<p>"An evening or two before his departure from Weldehall, he offered me
the continuance of the same friendship, which had always subsisted
betwixt us, if I would promise not to open my lips to you about this
matter.</p>

<p>"The morning of his departure, he burst out all of a sudden, when the
subject was not talked of, into threatenings, and told me, that, if I
ever entered upon this subject with you, I should repent it. He went out
of the house presently, and these were almost his last words."</p>

<p>The circumstance of these "threatenings" is amply confirmed by a letter
of Vincent himself, addressed to the Marchioness; an admirable specimen
of the outpouring of a vulgar and insolent mind:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I will venture to say I have the knack of parrying and
managing him, but that Mr. Hume, who is so extraordinarily
well paid, only for his company, and lodged and lives, that,
if it was at his own expense, he could not do it for £200
a-year, should be gloomy and inconsolable for want of society,
and show, for this good while past, little or no sign of
content or gratitude to me for all I have done, and the best
intentions to serve him, and principally promoted his being in
this station, and repeatedly offered to come out frequently
during the winter and stay two or three days at a time, whilst
he should be in town. I shall do so, but nowise in
consideration to him, but out of tenderness and regard to our
friend. Mr. Hume is a scholar, and I believe an honest man;
but one of his <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_190" id="Page_v1_190">[190]</a></span>best friends at Edinburgh at first wrote me,
he had conversed more with books than the world, or any of the
elegant part of it, chiefly owing to the narrowness of his
fortune. He does not in this case seem to know his own
interest, though I have long perceived it is what he mostly
has a peculiar eye to. Hereafter I shall consider him no more
than if I had never known him. Our friend in reality does not
desire he should stay with him. I don't see his policy in
offering to oppose my pleasure, and think it very wrong in him
to mention his appealing to Sir James Johnstone. I dare say
your ladyship thinks as I do, that it is unbecoming for me to
be in a subservient state, in such a case, to any body. I am
very zealously disposed to be accountable to you; both regard,
civility, justice, long friendship and acquaintance, as well
as near relationship, are all the motives in the world for it;
and I hoped my being concerned would produce all possible good
effects in your having constant, true, and satisfactory
accounts, as well as that, in due time, those advantages in
your own affairs might be accruing, which you are so justly
entitled to, and which I have before declared to be one of the
main ends to be accomplished, and which I believe you think I
could effect better than another. It is not one of the most
pleasing circumstances that, in the situation of our friend,
it is an inlet to strangers, taken in by accident, to be too
much acquainted with private family affairs. I certainly
desire that Sir James and I should be in good correspondence,
and I believe he is satisfied of that; but this man, taking it
into his head to thwart my methods, and all to gratify his own
desire of being near town in the winter forsooth, after the
offer I have made of giving him relief sometimes, <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_191" id="Page_v1_191">[191]</a></span>and as
nothing will satisfy some dispositions, I shall, at the end of
the year, close all accounts, in which there will be done what
was never done before, a complete state of the receipt and the
expense, and then very willingly desire to be excused from
having any farther concern. Most certainly I would do every
thing in my power to serve and oblige you; but if you desire
the continuance of my care, please to write to Sir James to
signify occasionally to Mr. Hume that the management is left
to me, and not to a stranger, who, if he is not satisfied, is
at his liberty to remove from such attendance."</p>
</div>


<p>This illustration of character would be incomplete without a passage in
a subsequent letter, in which, after Hume had ceased to attend on the
Marquis, Vincent characterizes the sort of person who would be a
desirable successor.</p>

<p>"If any proper person is about him again whilst I am concerned, terms
for their behaviour must be specified, and as they wax fat and are
encouraged, they must be discreet enough and reasonable in their nature,
so as not to kick. Such deportment would engage any good offices of
mine, in favour of a worthy man, fit for the purpose, which, I confess,
is very hard to find, and possibly my Lord will not care to have any
body put upon him by way of terms of continuance."</p>

<p>That the iron of this bondage entered into his soul, is apparent in many
passages of Hume's letters. He regretted that he had left independence
in a humble home, for dependence in a lordly mansion: he regretted that
he had been led to meddle with intrigues, in which a vulgar selfish man,
who knew <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_192" id="Page_v1_192">[192]</a></span>the world, was far more than a match for a profound
philosopher. How wise it had been for him had he never deserted the
humble prospects of an independent life, the following complaints,
addressed to Lord Elibank, testify:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Meanwhile, I own to you, that my heart rebels against this
unworthy treatment; and nothing but the prospect of depending
entirely on you, and being independent of him, could make me
submit to it. I have fifty resolutions about it. My loss, in
ever hearkening to his treacherous professions, has been very
great; but, as it is now irreparable, I must make the best of
a bad bargain. I am proud to say that, as I am no plotter
myself, I never suspect others to be such, till it be too
late; and, having always lived independent, and in such a
manner as that it never was any one's interest to profess
false friendship to me, I am not sufficiently on my guard in
this particular.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My way of living is more melancholy than
ever was submitted to by any human creature, who ever had any
hopes or pretensions to any thing better; and if to
confinement, solitude, and bad company, be also added these
marks of disregard, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I shall say nothing, but only that
books, study, leisure, frugality, and independence, are a
great deal better."</p>
</div>

<p>The filling up of the cup of his slights and injuries, and the
termination of his servitude, is thus described by Hume; and one reads
it with a feeling of relief, as an event long protracted, and for the
occurrence of which the reader of the narrative is impatient. He says,
writing to Sir James Johnstone, on 17th April, 1746,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll be surprised, perhaps, that I date my letters <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_193" id="Page_v1_193">[193]</a></span>no longer from
Weldehall; this happened from an accident, if our inconstancies and
uncertainties can be called such.</p>

<p>"You may remember in what humour you saw your friend a day or two before
you left us. He became gay and good-humoured afterwards, but more
moderately than usual. After that, he returned to his former
disposition. These revolutions, we have observed, are like the hot and
cold fits of an ague: and, like them too, in proportion as the one is
gentle, the other is violent. But the misfortune is, that this prejudice
continued even after he seemed, in other respects, entirely recovered.
So that, having tried all ways to bring him to good humour, by talking
with him, absenting myself for some days, &amp;c., I have at last been
obliged yesterday to leave him. He is determined, he says, to live
altogether alone; and I fancy, indeed, it must come to that. As far as I
can judge, this caprice came from nobody, and no cause, except physical
ones. The wonder only is, that it was so long a-coming."</p>

<p>There is a stroke of generosity in his thus attributing the impulse to
physical causes, and not only abstaining from an accusation of his
enemy, but expressly exempting him from all blame. The readers of the
correspondence have not probably all seconded the charitable exemption;
and the exulting tones in which Vincent speaks of the dismissal, foster
the suspicion that he had paved the way for it. He says, on the 19th
April,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"This day was a fortnight, my Lord told Mr. Hume to be gone,
and that in terms which I shall not repeat; the Monday
following, the same directions were renewed in a very
peremptory manner, attended with such expressions of
resentment, that I advised Hume to go <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_194" id="Page_v1_194">[194]</a></span>away the next day,
which he did, the 8th; and on the 15th I went out thither, and
had told my Lord before, that, if he could be reconciled to
have him return, I was very willing to contribute towards it,
which proposal was not in the least agreed to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hume has not
for many months stomached depending in any respect upon my
decision, who was originally the cause of his being received
at all, and had very great difficulty, long since and at
different times, to get my Lord to bear him. He has mistaken
the point; for there is nothing irritates his Lordship so
much, as the thought of any one showing some tokens of
authority, and looking on what he says as caprice, and of no
consequence; and I really believe it is some such notion as
this, which has produced so thorough an aversion."</p>
</div>

<p>There are two different views that may be taken of Hume's motives for
not having at once resigned his appointment, at the very commencement of
the train of indignities to which he was subjected. Whoever anticipates
that a man who had tutored his mind by the rules of philosophy, and who
lived an upright and independent life, may be actuated by some better
views than those of mere pecuniary aggrandizement, will give him credit
for having believed it to be his duty to watch over certain interests of
the Annandale family at the sacrifice of his own feelings. Those who,
strongly disapproving of his opinions as a philosopher, believe them to
be therefore the dictate of a corrupted mind, will probably search for
base and selfish motives; and will have little difficulty in identifying
them with a pure love of gain, sufficiently strong to absorb all
gentlemanly feeling and all spirit of independence. The favourable and
charitable view admits of no direct demonstration on which an opponent
could <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_195" id="Page_v1_195">[195]</a></span>not be able to throw doubt; and, the circumstances being stated,
each reader is left to form his own opinion.</p>

<p>There is one thing that Hume never attempts to conceal&mdash;his feeling that
the situation was in a pecuniary point of view advantageous to him, and
his consequent desire to preserve it for his own sake, so long as he
could do so with honour. That it should be so is one of those
inconsistencies often exhibited in fine geniuses, which ordinary men of
the world find it difficult to appreciate. It frequently proceeds from
this circumstance, that, not being acquainted with the ordinary beaten
tracks towards wealth and independence, which other men so easily find;
yet desiring the latter, although perhaps they care not for the former
endowment, they lay hold with avidity on any guide that is likely to
lead them, by however devious and unpleasant a path, to the desired
object. Men whose minds are much occupied with abstract subjects, if
they be poor and desire to be free of unpleasant obligations, are thus
apt to grasp at trifling rights with a pertinacity which has the air of
selfishness. They feel a timidness of their own ability to make way in a
bustling active world; and, conscious that it would be vain to compete
with hard-headed acute men of business in the enlargement of their
fortune, treat with an undue importance any comparatively trifling
claims and advantages; while the sagacious world, which sees before it
so many more advantageous paths to the objects of men's secondary
ambition, ridicules their much ado about nothing. It was Hume's first
and chief desire to be independent. That if he had enjoyed a choice of
means, to be the hired companion of the Marquis of Annandale would have
been among the last on which he would have fixed, <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_196" id="Page_v1_196">[196]</a></span>will easily be
believed. But this occupation was the only method of gaining a
livelihood that offered itself at the time; it was an honest one, and
the disagreeable circumstances attending the means were overlooked in
the desirableness of the end.</p>

<p>It is necessary, also, along with the account of Hume's efforts to gain
a humble livelihood, to keep in mind the state of society in Scotland at
that time. The union with England had introduced new habits of living,
which made the means of the smaller aristocracy insufficient for the
support of their younger children. On the other hand, England was
jealous of Scottish rivalry in foreign trade: neither agriculture nor
manufactures had made any considerable progress in Scotland; while
Indian enterprise was in its infancy, and Scottish adventurers in the
East had not yet found a Pactolus in the Ganges. At that period the
gentleman-merchant, manufacturer, or money dealer; the civil engineer,
architect, editor, or artist, were nearly unknown in Scotland. The only
form in which a man poor and well born could retain the rank of a
gentleman, if he did not follow one of the learned professions, was by
obtaining a commission in the army, or a government civil
appointment.<a name="FNanchor_196:1_105" id="FNanchor_196:1_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_196:1_105" class="fnanchor">[196:1]</a></p>

<p>Here ended the channels to subsistence along with <!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_197" id="Page_v1_197">[197]</a></span>gentility, and he who
had none of these paths open to him, and had resolved to make an
independent livelihood by his own talents or labour, had at once, as the
German nobles frequently do in the present day, to abandon his rank, and
become a shopkeeper or small farmer, probably with the intention of
returning to the bosom of his former social circle when he had realized
an independence, but more commonly ending his days with the
consciousness that he was, in the words of Henry Hunt, "the first of a
race of gentlemen who had become a tradesman." Any lawyer who pays
attention to the statistics of the Scottish decisions in mercantile
cases, during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, will have
noticed how frequently it occurs that the younger sons of some good
family are mentioned as fulfilling the humblest duties of village
tradesmen.<a name="FNanchor_197:1_106" id="FNanchor_197:1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_197:1_106" class="fnanchor">[197:1]</a> The practice is now comparatively unknown. The well
<!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_198" id="Page_v1_198">[198]</a></span>educated gentleman's son, if he be brought up to commerce, connects
himself with those more liberal departments of it, in which he may reap
the advantage of his education and training. To the practice which
distinguished the period of depression above alluded to, aided perhaps
by the spirit of clanship, we may owe the existence of so many
aristocratic names among the humbler tradesmen in Scotland. In England
the nomenclature of a city directory will as surely indicate the court
and the tradesmen end of the town, as the Norman name used to indicate
nobility and the Saxon vassalage. We do not find Edward Plantagenet
keeping an oyster shop, or Henry Seymour cobbling shoes; but it would
not be difficult to exemplify these humble occupations, in the regal
names of a Robert Bruce or a James Stuart. In his essay on "The Parties
of Great Britain," published in 1741, Hume alludes to the absence of a
middle class in Scotland, where he says there are only "two ranks of
men," "gentlemen who have some fortune and education, and the meanest
starving poor: without any considerable number of the middling rank of
men, which abounds more in England, both in cities and in the country,
than in any other quarter of the world."<a name="FNanchor_198:1_107" id="FNanchor_198:1_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_198:1_107" class="fnanchor">[198:1]</a></p>

<p>The history of the miserable quarrels and intrigues <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_199" id="Page_v1_199">[199]</a></span>connected with
Hume's residence in the Annandale family, is a sad picture, not only of
the position of the individual, but of his class,&mdash;the poor scholars,
the servile drudges for bread. The modern literary labourer&mdash;or hack, as
he is called by those who deem the word labourer too respectable to be
employed on such an occasion&mdash;may look from the narrow bounds of his own
independent home, with a feeling of sincere though not boastful
superiority on David Hume, living in the splendid bondage of a peer's
mansion. But in drawing the comparison on which the reflection rests,
let him keep in view the state of literature and of society at that
period, and ask where lay the hopes of the literary labourer? If he
remained in the less conspicuous walks of learned industry, and became a
divine or a teacher, there was before him the career of Parson Adams,
taking his pot and pipe with the upper servants; or that of the
threadbare tutor, subjected to the caprice and insolence of young men,
who, if they do not happen to be endowed with a high tone of sentiment,
must imbibe from all around them this feeling, that they are as far
beyond the parallel of rank of their instructor, as the Brahmin is
beyond that of the Pariah; or, thirdly, he might be the hired victim of
a semi-maniac, whose few rays of remaining reason are but sufficient to
indicate his own immeasurable superiority to the bought attendant of his
humours. These were the resources of the man who distrusted the power of
his own genius to soar into the higher flights of original literature;
the man, who might perhaps be too conscientious, not to say also too
timid, to throw the chance of his being able to meet his obligations to
society and to perform his social duties, on the chance of his
succeeding in the race for literary distinction.</p>

<p><!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_200" id="Page_v1_200">[200]</a></span>But suppose the race run and gained, and the laurels on the victor's
brow,&mdash;for what, then, has all been risked, all encountered? True, Hume
himself became one of the distinguished few who gained both fame and
fortune; but in the ordinary case, if the former were achieved, the
latter did not follow; and in seeking the types of literary distinction
in his age, Fielding, Goldsmith, and Johnson are the names that rise
before us. Was the garden in which these flowers bloomed so genial that
we would have others transplanted thither?</p>

<p>Let not, then, the considerate and charitable reader overlook all these
palliations of the motives which may have induced a great man to humble
himself and bear so much contumely. Let us suppose that he who reads
this narrative is an editor of a newspaper, with a salary of say two or
three hundred a-year; or that he writes articles for the periodicals,
and neither in name nor in reality bound to any one, gets the fair price
of his independent labour; or that he is a teacher in an active
commercial academy, who, after the harassing labours of the day, can
retire to the bosom of his own family, without fearing the frown or
desiring the smile of any great man,&mdash;let him, if such should be his
lot, indulge, in all its luxury, the consciousness of his superior
independence and happier fate; but in looking from its elevation to
David Hume, a bondman in the house of an insane lord, let compassion
rather than contempt tinge his estimate of the illustrious victim's
motives, and let him thank the better times, that with all the drudgery
of his lot, its disappointed aspirations, and the bitterness of
unavailing efforts to raise it to a higher and more justly-respected
position in the eye of the world, have yet enabled him to quaff the
sweet cup of independence.</p>

<p><!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_201" id="Page_v1_201">[201]</a></span>Before entirely leaving the subject of Hume's connexion with the Marquis
of Annandale, it is necessary to take a view of his conduct regarding a
pecuniary dispute which arose out of the transaction. The terms of the
agreement were very distinctly set forth by Captain Vincent in the
following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;You desire to have a letter from me, expressing all the
conditions of the agreement concluded betwixt us, with regard to your
living with the Marquis of Annandale. In compliance with so reasonable a
request, I hereby acknowledge that, by virtue of powers committed to me
by the said Marquis, and with the approbation and consent of his
Lordship and Sir James Johnstone, I engaged that my Lord should pay you
three hundred pounds sterling a-year, so long as you continued to live
with him, beginning from the first of April, one thousand seven hundred
and forty-five: also that the said Marquis, or his heirs, should be
engaged to pay you, or your heirs, the sum of three hundred pounds, as
one year's salary, even though the Marquis should happen to die any time
in the first year of your attendance, or should embrace any new scheme
or plan of life, which should make him choose that you should not
continue to live out the first year with him. Another condition was,
that, if you should, on your part, choose to leave the Marquis any time
in the first or subsequent years, you should be free to do it; and that
the Marquis should be bound to pay you your salary for the time you had
attended him, and also the salary for that quarter in which you should
leave him, in the same manner as if that quarter should be fully
expired.</p>

<p>"These were the conditions of our agreement about the end of February
last, on your first coming up to London for the purposes here mentioned,
and which I <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_202" id="Page_v1_202">[202]</a></span>have committed to writing for your satisfaction and
security, this first day of September, at Weldehall, four miles south of
St. Alban's, in the county of Hertford, and in the year one thousand
seven hundred and forty-five."</p>

<p>Vincent, in continuation, and for Hume's information, gives him a copy
of the agreement, under which one of his predecessors in office, by name
Peter Young, had been engaged; an agreement, containing terms rather
more favourable to the stipendiary than those of which Hume had
consented to accept. And he concludes,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see the latter part of Mr. Young's agreement are more advantageous
terms than the latter part of yours; but I have done as much as I
thought reasonable and proper for me, and as much as you desired. I make
no doubt but, in any contingency, all the Marquis's friends and
relations, would be far from reducing your conditions less than that of
others in the same case, as, in my opinion, and I dare believe in
theirs, your character and conduct would rather entitle you to a
preference."</p>

<p>Hume had in the mean time received a present of £100 from the Marquis of
Annandale, no reference to which is made in the agreement, and which he
considered as a gratuity to induce him to leave Scotland, and enter on
those negotiations with Lord Annandale and his friends, which ended in
his being engaged, but might have ended otherwise; as an indemnity, in
short, for the time wasted and the trouble taken in the preliminary
arrangements. Indeed, it will have been noticed in his letter to Mr.
Sharp, quoted above,<a name="FNanchor_202:1_108" id="FNanchor_202:1_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:1_108" class="fnanchor">[202:1]</a> that this gratuity was sent by the Marquis
along with the <!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_203" id="Page_v1_203">[203]</a></span>invitation to Hume to repair to London and hold a
conference on the subject. Hume, then, was engaged at £300 a-year, with
the condition that for any broken quarter a full quarter's salary should
be paid. His engagement commenced on 1st April, 1745. It terminated on
the 15th April, 1746. He thus considered himself entitled to £300 as a
year's salary, and to £75 as the salary of the quarter, of which fifteen
days had run. In the mean time, however, just after the expiry of the
first year, it had occurred to the magnanimous Vincent, that though
better terms than those given to Hume, had been obtained by the Peter
Youngs and others, Hume's salary was twice as much as it should be, and
ought to be reduced by a half. Hume, as if he had been subdued in
spirit, by the life he had been leading&mdash;feeling as if his lot were
cast, and his fate fixed&mdash;oblivious of the glorious dreams of ambition
that had dawned on him ten years earlier in life and were yet to be
realized, seems to have calmly contemplated this pecuniary reduction,
and to have been inclined to agree to it if it should form the prelude
to a permanent engagement. He thus wrote to the mother of the Marquis.</p>

<p>"I had the honour of a letter from my Lord Marquis last spring, inviting
me to London, which I accordingly obeyed. He made me proposals of living
with him; and Mr. Vincent, in concert with Sir James Johnstone,
mentioned at first the yearly salary of £300 as an allowance which they
thought reasonable; because my Lord had always paid so much to all the
other gentlemen that attended him, even when his way of living, in other
particulars, was much more expensive than at present. Since that, Mr.
Vincent thinks this allowance too much, and proposes to reduce it from
£300 to £150. My answer was, that whatever <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_204" id="Page_v1_204">[204]</a></span>your Ladyship and my Lord
should think my attendance merited, that I would very willingly accept
of. As he still insisted on the reasonableness of his opinion, I have
used the freedom to apply to your Ladyship, to whose sentiments every
one, that has the honour of being connected with the family of
Annandale, owe so entire a deference. I shall not insist on any
circumstances in my own favour. Your Ladyship's penetration will easily
be able to discover those, as well as what may be urged in favour of Mr.
Vincent's opinion. And your determination shall be entirely submitted to
by me."</p>

<p>At the same time he appears to have submitted his grievances to the
consideration of his kind friend Henry Home, who, in a letter to Sir
James Johnstone, expresses views which will probably meet with more
sympathy than those announced by Hume himself.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Kames, 14th April, 1746.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have a letter from Mr. David Hume lately, which
surprised me not a little, as if there were a plot formed
against him to diminish his salary. For my part, I was never
hearty in his present situation; as I did not consider the
terms offered as any sufficient temptation for him to
relinquish his studies, which, in all probability, would
redound more to his advantage some time or other. For this
reason, though I had a good deal of indignation at the
dishonourable behaviour of the author of this motion, yet
underhand I was not displeased with any occasion, not
blameable on my friend's part, to disengage him. I thought
instantly of writing him a letter not to stay upon any terms
after such an affront; but, reflecting upon your interest in
this matter, I found such an advice would <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_205" id="Page_v1_205">[205]</a></span>be inconsistent
with the duty I owe you, and therefore stopped short till I
should hear from you. I'm well apprized of the great
tenderness you have for your poor chief; and it is certainly
of some consequence that he should have about him at least one
person of integrity; and it should have given me pain to be
the author of an advice that might affect you, though but
indirectly. At the same time, I cannot think of sacrificing my
friend, even upon your account, to make him submit to
dishonourable terms; and, therefore, if you esteem his
attendance of any use to the Marquis, I beg you'll interpose
that no more attempts of this kind be made. For I must be so
free to declare that, should he himself yield to accept of
lower terms, which I trust he will not be so mean-spirited to
do, he shall never have my consent, and I know he will not act
without it."</p>
</div>


<p>The Marchioness declined to interfere, and thus the award by which Hume
agreed to abide was not made. He had thus began the first quarter of a
new year under the old agreement, and he had not consented either to
abandon the terms of that agreement for the time that was running, or
even to make new terms applicable to any subsequent period, though he
had shown a disposition to accept, under certain circumstances, of these
new terms. His abrupt dismissal, however, put an end to the negotiation;
and, as the terms of his agreement entitled him to the £75 if he had
chosen to throw up his appointment, he thought he was not the less
entitled to the money that he had been dismissed, and that the
ignominious and insulting treatment connected with his dismissal should
not be any inducement to him to abandon his claim. He could not lose
sight, moreover, of the circumstance, that to place the parties more at
their ease in dealing <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_206" id="Page_v1_206">[206]</a></span>with him, he had abandoned his claims on the
professorship in Edinburgh. It is true that he had small chance of
obtaining it, but that chance, such as it was, he was desired by the
friends of the Marquis to abandon, and he did so. The question with him
then was, how much injury he should allow to be added to the insults he
had received. The £300, for his year's services, were paid. The payment
of the £75, for the subsequent quarter, was resisted.</p>

<p>On the 9th June, 1746, Henry Home wrote a sensible and kind letter on
the subject to Sir James Johnstone, in which he laid down the law of the
case, that Hume's claim of salary for the broken quarter must be on the
old agreement, and could not be "upon the footing of a proposal or
offer, which never came the length of a covenant, and which, therefore,
never had any effect;" and he says,&mdash;"The question then is, whether he
is entitled to £75, for the broken quarter, or only to £37, 10s. The
thing is a mere trifle to the Marquis of Annandale, but of some
importance to a young gentleman who has not a large stock; and supposing
the claim to be doubtful, I have great confidence in your generosity,
that for a trifle you would not choose to leave a grudge in the young
gentleman's mind, of a hardship done to him.</p>

<p>"But to deal with you after that plain manner which I know you love, I
will speak out my mind to you, that in strict justice, and in the direct
words of the agreement, Mr. Hume is entitled to £75."</p>

<p>Hume never entirely abandoned this claim. He was not in a position to
urge it forward immediately after his dismissal, as another and more
agreeable official appointment called him abroad. So late as 1760 and
during the next ensuing year, we find him urging his <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_207" id="Page_v1_207">[207]</a></span>demand, and
allusion is made to an action having been raised in the Court of
Session. "The case," says Dr. Murray, "must have been settled
extrajudicially or by reference; for, after a careful search in the
minute book of the Court of Session, we do not find that it was ever
enrolled."</p>

<p>There has been a general tendency to consider this pertinacious
adherence to a pecuniary claim, as a proceeding unworthy of a
philosopher. In any ordinary man, whether wise or foolish after the
wisdom of the world, such conduct would have appeared but just and
natural; but a philosopher is presumed to have no more respect for money
and its value, than the generous and sympathizing gentleman on the
stage, who on the impulse of the moment, always tosses a heavy purse to
somebody, without having any more distinct notion of its contents than
the admiring audience can have. Hume's notions of these matters were
different. "Am I," he said, "in a condition to make the Marquis of
Annandale a present of £75, that of right belongs to me." It is true
that in the interval between the debt being incurred, and his insisting
on its payment, he had by frugality and industry made himself
independent. In 1747, he tells us that he was possessed of £1000, and in
1760, his fortune had probably considerably increased, though the
sources of emolument which made him subsequently worth £1000 a-year, had
not been then opened up. The surplus of the Marquis of Annandale's
estate had in the mean time accumulated in the manner that has been
already mentioned, and Hume probably thought it was an action more truly
worthy of a philosopher, to make over his salary of librarian to the
poor blind poet Blacklock, than to <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_208" id="Page_v1_208">[208]</a></span>abandon a claim of £75, justly due
by an estate which had developed a surplus of £400,000.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p>Early in the year 1746, Hume received an invitation from General St.
Clair, "to attend him as a secretary to his expedition, which was at
first meant against Canada, but ended in an incursion on the coast of
France."<a name="FNanchor_208:1_109" id="FNanchor_208:1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_208:1_109" class="fnanchor">[208:1]</a> Before his departure, and while he expected to have to
cross the Atlantic, he wrote the following letter, addressed to "Mr.
Alexander Home, Advocate, His Majesty's Solicitor for Scotland, at
Edinburgh." The concluding remarks evidently relate to the state
prosecutions following on the insurrection in Scotland.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Portsmouth, May 23, 1746.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Solicitor</span>,&mdash;A letter you have good reason to expect from
me, before my departure for America; but a long one you cannot
look for, if you consider that I knew not a word of this
matter till Sunday last at night, that we shall begin to
embark from hence in two or three days, and that I had very
ingeniously stripped myself of every thing, by sending down my
whole baggage for Scotland on Sunday morning. Such a romantic
adventure, and such a hurry I have not heard of before. The
office is very genteel&mdash;10s. a day, perquisites, and no
expenses. Remember me kindly to your brothers. Tell Frank I
ask him ten thousand pardons. Let Mr. Dysart, and Mrs. Dysart
know of my good wishes. Be assured yourself of my friendship.
I cannot leave Europe without giving you one instance of it,
and so much the greater that with regard to any other person
<!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_209" id="Page_v1_209">[209]</a></span>but you, it would be a dangerous one. In short, I have been
told, that the zeal of party has been apt sometimes to carry
you too far in your expressions, and that fools are afraid of
your violence in your new office. Seek the praise, my dear
Sandy, of humanity and moderation. 'Tis the most durable, the
most agreeable, and in the end the most profitable.</p>

<p class="author">"I am, dear Sandy, yours most sincerely.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, think of <em>Willy Hamilton</em>."<a name="FNanchor_209:1_110" id="FNanchor_209:1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:1_110" class="fnanchor">[209:1]</a></p>
</div>


<p>At the same time we find him writing to Henry Home, and speculating on
the possibility of himself joining the military service.</p>

<p>"As to myself, my way of life is agreeable; and though it may not be so
profitable as I am told, yet so large an army as will be under the
general's command in America, must certainly render my perquisites very
considerable. I have been asked, whether I would incline to enter into
the service? My answer was, that at my years I could not decently accept
of a lower commission than a company. The only prospect of working this
point would be, to procure at first a company in an American regiment,
by the choice of the colonies. But this I build not on, nor indeed am I
very fond of it.<a name="FNanchor_209:2_111" id="FNanchor_209:2_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:2_111" class="fnanchor">[209:2]</a> <span style="padding-left: 5em;">D. H."</span></p>

<p>The person to whom we thus find Hume acting in the capacity of
secretary, was the Honourable James St. Clair, one of those commanders
whose fortune it is to have passed through a long life of active
military service, without having one opportunity of performing a
distinguished action; for though, on the present occasion, the path to
honour appeared to be at last opened to him, it was closed by the
mismanagement of others. He was the second son of Henry Lord <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_210" id="Page_v1_210">[210]</a></span>St. Clair.
His elder brother being engaged in the rebellion of 1715, was attainted
by act of Parliament. The father left the family estates to General St.
Clair, who, with a generous devotion to the hereditary principle,
conveyed them to his elder brother, on that gentleman obtaining a pardon
and a statutory removal of the disabilities of the attainder. He
obtained the rank of colonel on 26th July, 1722, of major-general on
15th August, 1741, and of lieutenant-general on 4th June, 1745. During
the last named year he was quarter-master general of the British forces
in Flanders. He was for many years a member of Parliament, having been
elected for the Dysart burghs in 1722, and subsequently for the counties
of Sutherland and Fife. He died at Dysart on 30th November, 1762.<a name="FNanchor_210:1_112" id="FNanchor_210:1_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_210:1_112" class="fnanchor">[210:1]</a></p>

<p>The marine force connected with the proposed expedition was commanded by
Admiral Richard Lestock, a man whose professional fate was in some
respects of a like character with that of his military colleague. The
intended object of the armament was an attack on the French possessions
in Canada, and steps had been taken to second its efforts on the other
side of the Atlantic, by bringing together a British American force. But
the indolence or negligence of the authorities at home, delayed the
departure of the fleet until it was too late to attempt such an
enterprise; and then, as if to furnish a vivid illustration of weak and
blundering counsels, that all these preparations might not be thrown
away, the force prepared for operations in America was sent to attempt a
descent on the coast of France.</p>

<p>The naval force, consisting of sixteen ships of the <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_211" id="Page_v1_211">[211]</a></span>line, eight
frigates, and two bomb-ketches, accompanied by five thousand eight
hundred land troops, including matrosses and bombardiers, set sail from
Plymouth on 14th September.<a name="FNanchor_211:1_113" id="FNanchor_211:1_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_211:1_113" class="fnanchor">[211:1]</a> Its destination was the town of Port
L'Orient, then a flourishing port, as the depot of the French East India
Company, which has since fallen to decay in common with the great
establishment with which it was connected. The history and fate of the
expedition will be best described in Hume's own words. It afforded no
harvest of military glory to either country; and while it is but
slightly described by our own historians, it is scarcely ever mentioned
by those of France. National partiality will hardly make any lover of
the true glory of his country regret that such an attempt was a failure.
The method of conducting war by descents upon an enemy's coast, is a
relic of barbarism which it is to be hoped the progress of humanity and
civilisation will not permit either false enthusiasm or the auspices of
a great name to revive among the nations of Europe. It is precisely the
warlike tactic of the scalping knife&mdash;the wreaking against the weak that
vengeance which cannot reach the strong. The rules of civilized war are
to strike such blows as will annihilate the power of an enemy's
government, with the least injury to the peaceful inhabitants of the
country. Descents on a coast do much injury to individuals&mdash;they do
little harm to the enemy's government. It is a system by which the vital
parts are not attacked until they suffer by exhaustion from the injuries
done to the extremities. Such expeditions do a grievous injury to our
enemies, to accomplish a <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_212" id="Page_v1_212">[212]</a></span>very small good to ourselves. But if they
cannot be avoided, the next step of mercy is to make them effectual by
energetic and well-organized measures which render resistance hopeless,
and subject the places attacked only to the modified license of a
well-disciplined army. The blunders that made the present attempt as
contemptible as it was cruel, are amply recorded by Hume, and may be a
lesson of the responsibility incurred by those who fit out warlike
expeditions.</p>

<p>In this expedition Hume not only acted as secretary to the general, but
was appointed by him judge advocate of all the forces under his command,
by a commission "given on board his majesty's ship Superb, the third day
of August, 1746,"<a name="FNanchor_212:1_114" id="FNanchor_212:1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_212:1_114" class="fnanchor">[212:1]</a> in virtue of the power which the commander of
an army possesses to fill up a vacancy in that office. The mixed
ministerial and judicial duties of a judge advocate require a general
knowledge of the great principles of law and justice, with a freedom
from that technical thraldom of the practical lawyer which would be
unsuitable to the rapidity of military operations; and there can be
little doubt that these delicate and important functions were in this
instance committed to one in every way capable of performing them in a
satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>Some of Hume's permanent friendships appear to have been formed during
this expedition. General Abercromby, with whom we will afterwards find
him corresponding, was quarter-master general, Harry Erskine was deputy
quarter-master, and Edmonstoune of Newton was a captain in the Royal
Scottish regiment. Of the operations of the expedition, and some other
<!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_213" id="Page_v1_213">[213]</a></span>incidents of deep interest connected with it, he sent the following
narrative to his brother, John Hume, or Home, of Ninewells.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to his Brother</i>.</p>

<p>"Our first warlike attempt has been unsuccessful, though
without any loss or dishonour. The public rumour must
certainly have informed you that, being detained in the
Channel, till it was too late to go to America, the ministry,
who were willing to make some advantage of so considerable a
sea and land armament, sent us to seek adventures on the coast
of France. Though both the general and admiral were totally
unacquainted with every part of the coast, without pilots,
guides, or intelligence of any kind, and even without the
common maps of the country; yet, being assured there were no
regular troops near this whole coast, they hoped it was not
possible but something might be successfully undertaken. They
bent their course to Port L'Orient, a fine town on the coast
of Britanny, the seat of the French East India trade, and
which about twenty years ago was but a mean, contemptible
village. The force of this town, the strength of its garrison,
the nature of the coast and country, they professed themselves
entirely ignorant of, except from such hearsay information as
they had casually picked up at Plymouth. However, we made a
happy voyage of three days, landed in the face of about 3000
armed militia on the 20th of September, marched up next day to
the gates of L'Orient, and surveyed it.</p>

<p>"It lies at the bottom of a fine bay two leagues long, the
mouth of which is commanded by the town and citadel of Port
Louis, or Blavet, a place of great strength, and situated on a
peninsula. The town of <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_214" id="Page_v1_214">[214]</a></span>L'Orient itself has no great strength,
though surrounded by a new wall of about 30 foot high,
fortified with half moons, and guarded with some cannon. They
were in prodigious alarm at so unexpected an attack by numbers
which their fears magnified, and immediately offered to
capitulate, though upon terms which would have made their
conquest of no significancy to us. They made some advances a
few hours after, to abate of their demands; but the general
positively refused to accept of the town on any other
condition than that of surrendering at discretion. He had very
good reason for this seeming rigour and haughtiness. It has
long been the misfortune of English armies to be very
ill-served in engineers; and surely there never was on any
occasion such an assemblage of ignorant blockheads as those
which at this time attended us. They positively affirmed it
was easily in their power, by the assistance of a mortar and
two twelve pounders, in ten hours' time, either to lay the
town and East India magazine in ashes, or make a breach by
which the forces might easily enter. This being laid before
the general and admiral, they concluded themselves already
masters of the town,and<a name="FNanchor_214:1_115" id="FNanchor_214:1_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_214:1_115" class="fnanchor">[214:1]</a> needed grant no terms. They
were besides afraid that had they taken the town upon terms,
and redeemed it for a considerable sum of money, the good
people of England, who love mischief, would not be satisfied,
but would still entertain a suspicion that the success of his
majesty's arms had been secretly sold by his commanders.
Besides, nothing could be a greater blow to the French trade
than the destruction of this town; nor what<a name="FNanchor_214:2_116" id="FNanchor_214:2_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_214:2_116" class="fnanchor">[214:2]</a> could
imprint a stronger terror of the English naval power, and more
<!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_215" id="Page_v1_215">[215]</a></span>effectually reduce the French to a necessity of guarding
their coast with regular forces, which must produce a great
diversion from their ambitious projects on the frontiers. But
when the engineers came to execution, it was found they could
do nothing of what they had promised. Not one of their
carkasses or red hot balls took effect. As the town could not
be invested either by sea or land, they got a garrison of
irregulars and regulars, which was above double our number,
and played 35 pieces of cannon upon us while we could bring
only four against them. Excessive rains fell, which brought
sickness amongst our men that had been stowed in transports
during the whole summer. We were ten miles from the fleet, the
roads entirely spoilt, every thing was drawn by men, the whole
horses in the country being driven away. So much fatigue and
duty quite overcame our little army. The fleet anchored in a
very unsafe place in Quimperlay Bay. For these and other
reasons it was unanimously determined to raise the siege on
the 27th of September; and to this measure there was not one
contradictory opinion either in the fleet or army. We have not
lost above ten men by the enemy in the whole expedition, and
were not in the least molested either in our retreat or
re-embarkation. We met with a violent storm on the 1st of
October, while we were yet very near the coast, and have now
got into Quiberon Bay south of Belle-Isle, where we wait for a
reinforcement of three battalions from England. There are five
or six of our transports amissing. After our French projects
are over, which must be very soon because of the late season,
we sail to Cork and Kingsale.</p>

<p>"While we lay at Plœmeur, a village about a league from
L'Orient, there happened in our family one of <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_216" id="Page_v1_216">[216]</a></span>the most
tragical stories ever I heard of, and than which nothing ever
gave me more concern. I know not if ever you heard of Major
Forbes, a brother of Sir Arthur's. He was, and was esteemed, a
man of the greatest sense, honour, modesty, mildness, and
equality of temper, in the world. His learning was very great
for a man of any profession; but a prodigy for a soldier. His
bravery had been tried, and was unquestioned. He had exhausted
himself with fatigue and hunger for two days, so that he was
obliged to leave the camp and come to our quarters, where I
took the utmost care of him, as there was a great friendship
betwixt us. He expressed vast anxiety that he should be
obliged to leave his duty, and fear lest his honour should
suffer by it. I endeavoured to quiet his mind as much as
possible, and thought I had left him tolerably composed at
night; but, returning to his room early next morning, I found
him, with small remains of life, wallowing in his own blood,
with the arteries of his arm cut asunder. I immediately sent
for a surgeon, got a bandage tied to his arm, and recovered
him entirely to his senses and understanding. He lived above
four-and-twenty hours after, and I had several conversations
with him. Never a man expressed a more steady contempt of
life, nor more determined philosophical principles, suitable
to his exit. He begged of me to unloosen his bandage, and
hasten his death, as the last act of friendship I could show
him: but, alas! we live not in Greek or Roman times. He told
me that he knew he could not live a few days: but if he did,
as soon as he became his own master, he would take a more
expeditious method, which none of his friends could prevent.
'I die,' says he, 'from a jealousy of honour, perhaps too
delicate; and do you think, if it were possible for me to
live, I <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_217" id="Page_v1_217">[217]</a></span>would now consent to it, to be a gazing-stock to the
foolish world. I am too far advanced to return. And if life
was odious to me before, it must be doubly so at present.' He
became delirious a few hours before he died. He had wrote a
short letter to his brother, above ten hours before he cut his
arteries. This we found on the table."</p>

<p class="datelineit">"Quiberon Bay in Britanny, Oct. 4, 1746."</p>

<p class="section">"P.S.&mdash;The general has not sent off his despatches till
to-day, so that I have an opportunity of saying a few words
more. Our army disembarked on the 4th of October, and took
possession of the peninsula of Quiberon, without opposition.
We lay there, without molestation, for eight days, though the
enemy had formed a powerful, at least a numerous, army of
militia on the continent. The separation of so many of our
transports, and the reinforcements not coming, determined us
to reimbark, and return home, with some small hopes that our
expedition has answered the chief part of its intended
purpose, by making a diversion from the French army in
Flanders. The French pretend to have gained a great victory;
but with what truth we know not. The admiral landed some
sailors, and took possession of the two islands of Houat and
Hedie, which were secured by small forts. The governor of one
of them, when he surrendered his fort, delivered up his purse
to the sea officer, and begged him to take care of it, and
secure it from the pillage of the sailors. The officer took
charge of it, and, finding afterwards a proper opportunity to
examine it, found it contained the important sum of ten sous,
which is less than sixpence of our money."<a name="FNanchor_217:1_117" id="FNanchor_217:1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_217:1_117" class="fnanchor">[217:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_218" id="Page_v1_218">[218]</a></span>
As Niebuhr was an eye-witness of the battle of Copenhagen, so Hume also
had thus an opportunity of observing some practical warlike operations,
though they were on a much smaller scale, and were witnessed in much
less exciting circumstances than those which attended the position of
the citizen of Copenhagen. Thus, although not themselves soldiers, these
two great historians swell the list, previously containing the names of
Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, Guicciardini, Davila, and Rapin, of
those historians of warfare who have witnessed its practical operation.
Voltaire, when the accuracy of his description of a battle was
questioned by one who had been engaged in it, bid the soldier keep to
his profession of fighting, and not interfere with another man's, which
was that of writing; but there is little doubt, that the person who
would accurately describe military manœuvres, will have his task
facilitated by having actually witnessed some warlike operations, on
however small a scale, and however unlike in character to those which he
has to describe. Scott considered that he had derived much of his
facility as a narrative historian from his services in the Mid-Lothian
yeomanry; and Gibbon found that to be an active officer in the Hampshire
militia was not without its use to the historian of the latter days of
Rome.</p>

<p>It is pretty clear that Hume looked upon these operations, not only as
events likely to furnish him with some critical knowledge of warlike
affairs, but with the inquiring eye of one who might have an opportunity
of afterwards narrating them in some historical work. In the appendix
there will be found a pretty minute account by Hume, of the causes which
led to the failure of the expedition, in a paper apparently drawn up as
a vindication of the conduct <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_219" id="Page_v1_219">[219]</a></span>of General St. Clair. It does not appear
to have been printed, although it seems to have been designed for the
press. It contains the following passage: "A certain foreign writer,
more anxious to tell his stories in an entertaining manner than to
assure himself of their reality, has endeavoured to put this expedition
in a ridiculous light; but as there is not one circumstance in his
narration that has truth in it, or even the least appearance of truth,
it would be needless to lose time in refuting it."</p>

<p>The following passage in a letter to Sir Harry Erskine, dated 20th
January, 1756,<a name="FNanchor_219:1_118" id="FNanchor_219:1_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_219:1_118" class="fnanchor">[219:1]</a> shows that he here alludes to Voltaire: "I have
been set upon by several to write something, though it were only to be
inserted in the Magazines, in opposition to this account which Voltaire
has given of our expedition. But my answer still is, that it is not
worth while, and that he is so totally mistaken in every circumstance of
that affair, and indeed of every affair, that I presume nobody will pay
attention to him. I hope you are of the same opinion." But if Voltaire
ever wrote on this subject, it must have been in one of those works of
which he took the liberty of determinedly denying the authorship, for
there appears to be nothing bearing on the subject in the usual editions
of his published and acknowledged works, and in his "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Précis du Siecle de
Louis XV.</span>," he passes over the expedition with the briefest possible
allusion.</p>

<p>We find Hume, on the return of the expedition, writing the following
letter to Henry Home. It contains some curious notices of its writer's
views and intentions, and betrays a sort of irresolution as to his
subsequent projects, which seems to have haunted him through life. It is
here that we find the first allusion <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_220" id="Page_v1_220">[220]</a></span>to his historical studies. The
extracts from his notes, or adversaria, printed above, show that he had
read much in history, but chiefly in that of the ancient nations. It
does not appear that he had yet paid any marked attention to British
history.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Henry Home</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am ashamed of being so long in writing to you.
If I should plead laziness, you would say I am much altered;
if multiplicity of business, you would scarce believe me; if
forgetfulness of you and our friendship, I should tell a gross
untruth. I can therefore plead nothing but idleness, and a
gay, pleasurable life, which steals away hour after hour, and
day after day, and leaves no time for such occupations as
one's sober reason may approve most of. This is our case while
on shore, and even while on board, as far as one can have much
enjoyment in that situation.</p>

<p>"I wrote my brother from the coast of Britanny; giving him
some account of our expedition, and of the causes of our
disappointment. I suppose he received it after you had left
the country, but I doubt not he has informed you of it. We
were very near a great success, the taking of L'Orient,
perhaps Port Louis, which would have been a prodigious blow to
France; and, having an open communication with the sea, might
have made a great diversion of their forces, and done great
service to the common cause. I suppose you are become a great
general, by the misfortune of the seat of war being so long in
your neighbourhood. I shall be able when we meet to give you
the just cause of our failure. Our expedition to North America
is now at an end; we are recalled to England, the convoy is
arrived, and we re-embark in a few <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_221" id="Page_v1_221">[221]</a></span>days. I have an invitation
to go over to Flanders with the general, and an offer of
table, tent, horses, &amp;c. I must own I have a great curiosity
to see a real campaign, but I am deterred by the view of the
expense, and am afraid, that living in a camp, without any
character, and without any thing to do, would appear
ridiculous. Had I any fortune which would give me a prospect
of leisure and opportunity to prosecute my <em>historical
projects</em>, nothing could be more useful to me, and I should
pick up more literary knowledge in one campaign, by living in
the general's family, and being introduced frequently to the
duke's, than most officers could do after many years' service.
But to what can all this serve? I am a philosopher, and so, I
suppose, must continue.</p>

<p>"I am very uncertain of getting half pay, from several strange
and unexpected accidents, which it would be too tedious to
mention; and if I get it not, shall neither be gainer nor
loser by the expedition. I believe, if I would have begun the
world again, I might have returned an officer, gratis; and am
certain, might have been made chaplain to a regiment gratis;
but<a name="FNanchor_221:1_119" id="FNanchor_221:1_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:1_119" class="fnanchor">[221:1]</a> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I need say no more. I shall stay a little time
in London, to see if any thing new will present itself. If
not, I shall return very cheerfully to books, leisure, and
solitude, in the country. An elegant table has not spoiled my
relish for sobriety; nor gaiety for study; and frequent
disappointments have taught me that nothing need be despaired
of, as well as that nothing can be depended on. You give
yourself violent airs of wisdom; you will say, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odi hominem
ignavâ operâ, philosophicâ <!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_222" id="Page_v1_222">[222]</a></span>sententiâ</i>. But you will not say
so when you see me again with my Xenophon or Polybius in my
hand; which, however, I shall willingly throw aside to be
cheerful with you, as usual. My kind compliments to Mrs. Home,
who, I am sorry to hear, has not yet got entirely the better
of her illness. I am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_222:1_120" id="FNanchor_222:1_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_222:1_120" class="fnanchor">[222:1]</a></p>
</div>


<p>We find Hume corresponding also with Oswald and Colonel Abercromby, as
to his claim of half-pay for his services as Judge Advocate in the
expedition; and this subject we find him occasionally resuming down to
so late a period as 1763, when he speaks of "insurmountable
difficulties," and fears he must "despair of success."<a name="FNanchor_222:2_121" id="FNanchor_222:2_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_222:2_121" class="fnanchor">[222:2]</a> It must be
admitted that when he thought fit to make a pecuniary claim he did not
easily resign it. His correspondent, Colonel Abercromby of Glassauch,
has already been mentioned as having held a command in the expedition.
He was afterwards one of Hume's intimate friends. Besides his rank in
the army, he held the two discordant offices of king's painter in
Scotland, and deputy-governor of Stirling castle. He was elected member
of parliament for the shire of Banff in 1735,<a name="FNanchor_222:3_122" id="FNanchor_222:3_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_222:3_122" class="fnanchor">[222:3]</a> and Hume's letters
contain congratulations on his re-election in 1747, along with some
incidents in his own journey towards Scotland.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Ninewells. 7th August, 1747.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Col<sup>l</sup>.</span>&mdash;I have many subjects to congratulate you upon.
The honour you acquired at Sandberg, your safety, and your
success in your elections. You are equally eminent in the arts
of peace and war. The cabinet is no less a scene of glory to
you than the field. You are a hero even in your sports and
<!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_223" id="Page_v1_223">[223]</a></span>amusements; and discover a superior genius in whist, as well
as in a state intrigue or in a battle.</p>

<p>"I hope you recover well of your wound, and I beg of you to
inform me. I should be glad to know what became of Forster,
and whether Bob Horne got the majority. I write to you upon
the supposition of your being at London; because Dr. Clephane
wrote me some time ago, that you was just setting out for it.
If that be the case please make my most humble compliments to
Mrs. Abercromby.</p>

<p>"If the Colonel be still detained abroad by any accident, I
must beg it of you, Mrs. Abercromby, to take these compliments
to yourself, and to keep this letter till the Colonel comes
over, for it is not worth while to pay postage for it. I
suppose, madam, that Lady Abercromby informed you of our happy
voyage together, and safe arrival in Newcastle: your young
cousin was a little noisy and obstreperous; our ship was
dirty; our accommodation bad; our company sick. There were
four spies, two informers, and three evidences, who sailed in
the same ship with us. Yet notwithstanding all these
circumstances, we were very well pleased with our voyage,
chiefly on account of its shortness, which indeed is almost
the only agreeable circumstance that can be in a voyage. I am,
&amp;c."</p>

<p>"To the royal in Bergen-op-zoom?<a name="FNanchor_223:1_123" id="FNanchor_223:1_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_223:1_123" class="fnanchor">[223:1]</a> Have they lost any
officers? I hope Guidelianus<a name="FNanchor_223:2_124" id="FNanchor_223:2_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_223:2_124" class="fnanchor">[223:2]</a> is safe? I hope Fraser is
converted?"</p>
</div>


<p>In his correspondence with Oswald on the same matter of his half-pay,
his remarks on public affairs are very desponding. He says,&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_224" id="Page_v1_224">[224]</a></span>"I know not whether I ought to congratulate you upon the success of
your election,<a name="FNanchor_224:1_125" id="FNanchor_224:1_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_224:1_125" class="fnanchor">[224:1]</a> where you prevailed so unexpectedly. I think the
present times are so calamitous, and our future prospect so dismal, that
it is a misfortune to have any concern in public affairs, which one
cannot redress, and where it is difficult to arrive at a proper degree
of insensibility or philosophy, as long as one is in the scene. You know
my sentiments were always a little gloomy on that head; and I am sorry
to observe, that all accidents (besides the natural course of events)
turn out against us. What a surprising misfortune is this
Bergen-op-zoom, which is almost unparalleled in modern history! I hear
the Dutch troops, besides their common cowardice, and ill-discipline,
are seized with an universal panic. This winter may perhaps decide the
fate of Holland, and then where are we? I shall not be much disappointed
if this prove the last parliament, worthy the name, we shall ever have
in Britain. I cannot therefore congratulate you upon your having a seat
in it: I can only congratulate you upon the universal joy and
satisfaction it gave to every body."<a name="FNanchor_224:2_126" id="FNanchor_224:2_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_224:2_126" class="fnanchor">[224:2]</a></p>

referring to him, edited by Thomas Murray, LL.D., author of "The
Literary History of Galloway." Edinburgh, 1841, 8vo, pp. 80. Dr. Murray
says of these letters: "The originals are supposed to have been
deposited, about eighty years ago, in the hands of a legal gentleman in
Edinburgh, as documents for a law-suit, to which the latter portion of
them refers. Since his death, they have, we believe, passed through
several hands without having attracted any particular attention, or,
perhaps, without having ever been read. They ultimately came into the
possession of a gentleman who appreciated their value, and who, several
years ago, did me the honour of presenting them unconditionally to me."</p>

of his state of mind, in the manner in which he gave a ball at Dumfries.
He had the floor covered with confections, as a garden walk is laid with
gravel. A lady who was alive a few years ago, remembered having seen him
walking about at Highgate, near London; when he was probably in a more
confirmed state of insanity than even his intercourse with Hume
exhibits: a keeper walked before him, and a footman behind. The latter
would occasionally tap his Lordship on the shoulder, and hand him a
snuff-box, whence he would take a pinch. He was a very handsome man. He
had a sister, who exercised so much influence over him, that in her
presence a keeper could be dispensed with.</p>

of John Sharp of Hoddam, by his wife Susan, daughter of John Muir of
Cassencarrie, ancestor of Sir John Muir Mackenzie of Delvin, Bart. Mr.
Sharp joined the Jacobite insurgents in the year 1715, and made his
escape to Scotland, after the rout at Preston, in the disguise of a
pig-driver. He then repaired to France, where he finally took up his
residence at Boulogne. In the year 1740 his elder brother George died,

the education of a young gentleman to bring him up to the expectation of
a government office, that in the "Institute of the Law of Scotland," the
posthumous work of John Erskine, who had been appointed professor of
Scots law in the university of Edinburgh in 1737, it is mentioned as one
of the duties of the guardian of a young man of good family with a small
patrimony, to "advance a yearly sum, far beyond the interest of his
patrimony, that he may appear suitably to his quality, while he is
unprovided of any office under the government by which he can live
decently." B. i. Tit. 7. § 25.</p>

the Scottish nobility, before "the forty-five," saying of Lord
Kilmarnock, "I don't know whether I told you that the man at the tennis
court protests that he has known him dine with the man that sells
pamphlets at Storey's gate, and says he would have often been glad if I
would have taken him home to dinner. He was certainly so poor that in
one of his wife's intercepted letters, she tells him she has plagued
their steward for a fortnight for money, and can only get three
shillings. Can any one help pitying such distress?" Walpole's Letters,
ii. 144.</p>

<p>Goldsmith found the holder of a Scottish Peerage keeping a glove shop,
and in the case of Lord Mordington, who had been arrested for debt, and
claimed his privilege in the Common Pleas, "the bailiff made affidavit,
that when he arrested the said lord, he was so mean in his apparel, as
having a worn out suit of clothes and a dirty shirt on, and but sixpence
in his pocket, he could not suppose him to be a peer of Great Britain,
and of inadvertency arrested him." Fortescue's Reports, 165. This family
was peculiarly celebrated, Lady Mordington having raised the question,
whether a Scottish peeress who kept a tavern was protected by privilege
of peerage from being amenable to the laws against keeping disorderly
houses.</p>

if not with his own family, of the practice of the gentry following
handicraft trades. George Hume, son of the minister of his native
parish, Chirnside, who was connected with his own family, followed the
humble occupation of a baker in the Canongate, and rose to the dignity
of deacon of his trade. Ill-natured tradition says, that the philosopher
disliked the vicinity to himself of this living illustration of the
depression of the Scottish aristocracy, and occasionally put himself to
some trouble to avoid meeting him on the street; but this tradition is
not consistent with Hume's manly character.</p>

<p class="section">We now find Hume restored, though but for a brief period, to the
tranquil retirement of Ninewells; and undisturbed by public events,
civil or warlike, sitting down quietly among his books in the midst of
his family circle, consisting of his mother, his elder brother, and his
sister. It would be interesting to obtain a glimpse of this circle and
its habits; but the lapse of nearly a century has thrown it too far into
the shade of time, to permit of these minute objects being
distinguished. Perhaps the following scrap from the papers preserved by
Hume himself,<a name="FNanchor_225:1_127" id="FNanchor_225:1_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:1_127" class="fnanchor">[225:1]</a> may represent the evening diversions of Ninewells.
It is written by another hand, but is touched and corrected here and
there by Hume. Whether or not it is intended to have any reference to
himself, is a matter on which I shall not attempt to forestall the
reader's judgment.</p>

<p>In the face, both of this assurance of the limited extent of Hume's
poetical efforts, and of the circumstance that he was occasionally in
the practice of copying such verses as pleased his ear,<a name="FNanchor_227:2_130" id="FNanchor_227:2_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_227:2_130" class="fnanchor">[227:2]</a> or fancy,
I venture to offer the following specimens of his versification,
admitting the possibility but not the probability that some minute
investigator might be able to identify them as the production of a less
distinguished bard. The censorious critic will probably admit their
genuineness, on the plea that no one but their author would commit such
verses to writing. But apart from their internal evidence, there is
every reason to presume that these efforts are by Hume. The first piece
is dated in the writer's hand, as if to mark the day when it was
composed. With the exception of <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_228" id="Page_v1_228">[228]</a></span>the third in order, they all contain,
in corrections and otherwise, decided marks of being composed by the
person in whose handwriting they are; and they are in the handwriting of
David Hume.<a name="FNanchor_228:1_131" id="FNanchor_228:1_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_228:1_131" class="fnanchor">[228:1]</a></p>

<p>The question, whether the man concerning whom a biographical work is
written was ever in love, is an important feature in his history, if any
light can be thrown upon it. Perhaps some readers will hold, that the
tameness of these verses show that, at all events, when he wrote <em>them</em>,
Hume was under the impulse of no passion. Very little more light can be
brought to bear on this subject; and what can be obtained, is of a like
faint and negative cast. He tells us in his "own life," "As I took a
particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I had no reason to
be displeased with the reception I met with from them." In his essays he
frequently discusses the passion of love, <!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_232" id="Page_v1_232">[232]</a></span>dividing it into its elements
about as systematically as if he had subjected it to a chemical
analysis, and laying down rules regarding it as distinctly and
specifically as if it were a system of logic. Nor do the references in
his correspondence to any individuals of the other sex, show any
perceptible warmth of sentiment. In a letter to Henry Home, of which the
other portions are printed above,<a name="FNanchor_232:1_132" id="FNanchor_232:1_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_232:1_132" class="fnanchor">[232:1]</a> he speaks with perhaps as much
appearance of sentiment as any where else, when he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thank Mrs. Home for her intelligence, and have much employed my brain
to find out the person she means. It could not be the widow: for she
toasts always the Duke of Argyle or Lord Stair, and never would name a
young man whom she may reasonably enough suppose to be in love with her.
I shall therefore flatter myself it was Miss Dalrymple. It is now
Exchequer term: she is among the few <em>very fine ladies</em> of Mrs. Home's
acquaintance, whom I have the happiness of knowing. In short, many
circumstances, besides my earnest wishes, concur to make me believe it
was she who did me that honour. I will persevere in that opinion; unless
you think it proper to disabuse me, for fear of my being too much puft
up with vanity by such a conceit."</p>

<p>His friend Jardine, writing to him when he was secretary of legation in
France, says, evidently in ironical reference to his notorious want of
sensibility in this respect, "An inordinate love of the fair sex, as I
have often told you, is one of those sins, that always, even from your
earliest years, did most easily beset you."</p>

<p>Nor does the following passage in a letter from <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_233" id="Page_v1_233">[233]</a></span>Mr. Crawford,<a name="FNanchor_233:1_133" id="FNanchor_233:1_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:1_133" class="fnanchor">[233:1]</a>
dated, London, 9th December, 1766, seem to convey any more serious
charge:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What keeps you in Scotland? Lord Ossory says, it can be nothing but the
young beauty for whom you had formerly some passion. But we are both of
opinion, that she must now be old and ugly, and cannot be worthy to
detain you in so vile a country. Neither love nor wit can flourish
there, otherwise you would not have cracked such bad jokes upon
philosophers, the best subject in the world for joking upon. Then,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuge nate Deâ&mdash;<em>sterili teque abstrahe terrâ</em></span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Come up here, and I know not but what I may be able to introduce you to
a young beauty, such as your imagination never figured to itself. With
charms and accomplishments possessed by no other woman, she has an
understanding equal to that of Madame du Deffand.&mdash;Would to God she were
blind like her too, that I might dare to avow my passion for her."</p>

<p>If there be any thing in these passages tending to show a slight degree
of interest in the sex, their tendency will perhaps be fully neutralized
by Hume's exultation on the fortunate nature of his own happy
indifference, in a letter to Oswald, which will be found a few pages
<a href="#Oswald_letter">farther</a> on. It must be confessed, indeed, that, according to all
appearance, the appellation, more expressive than classical, frequently
used on such occasions, is applicable to Hume, and that he was a "sad
indifferent dog."</p>

<p>To return to the verses.&mdash;The following is a specimen of a totally
different cast; and, if less ambitious in its pretensions, it will
probably be thought to have <!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_234" id="Page_v1_234">[234]</a></span>more successfully accomplished what it aims
at. It is called "An Epistle to Mr. John Medina," a son of Sir John
Medina, the celebrated painter, to whom, probably from the habits hinted
at in the verses, he was a far inferior artist. He is believed to have
been the painter of a large portion of the very numerous extant
portraits of Queen Mary. It would be difficult at this day to discover
the individual whom he is here called upon to portray, with attributes
about as grotesque as those of his inexplicable countryman, Aiken Drum.
As several names of persons who were active supporters of the measures
of social economy, and the agricultural improvements alluded to in the
verses, might be adduced, but no one can be named to whom they appear
distinctly and exclusively to apply, it may be less invidious to present
them in the form of a purely imaginative picture, than to associate them
with any name.</p>

<p>Hume was again called away from the studious retirement of Ninewells, by
being appointed secretary to the mission of his friend General St.
Clair, to the court of Turin. The real object of the mission, in
whatever aspect it might have been openly represented, certainly was to
satisfy the British court on the question, whether Sardinia, and perhaps
some of the other stipendiary states, had furnished their respective
quotas of men to the war. The following letter by Hume to his friend
Oswald, details many of his feelings on assuming this new duty. It will
be found to be as different in tone from his previous letters, as the
life he was entering on was different from his hermit <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_236" id="Page_v1_236">[236]</a></span>retirement at
Ninewells, or his slavery at Weldhall. This letter, indeed, appears to
mark an epoch in his correspondence. It is the first in which he
mentions miscellaneous public events, with the feeling of one who takes
an interest in the living politics of his time; and shows that the brief
episode of active practical life, in which he had just borne a share,
and the prospect of a renewal of such scenes, had opened his mind to the
reception of external impressions.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<a name="Oswald_letter" id="Oswald_letter"></a><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">James Oswald</span>.</p>

<p>"I have little more to say to you than to bid you adieu before
I leave this country. I got an invitation from General St.
Clair, to attend him in his new employment at the court of
Turin, which I hope will prove an agreeable, if not a
profitable jaunt for me. I shall have an opportunity of seeing
courts and camps; and if I can afterwards be so happy as to
attain leisure and other opportunities, this knowledge may
even turn to account to me, as a man of letters, which, I
confess, has always been the sole object of my ambition. I
have long had an intention, in my riper years, of composing
some history; and I question not but some greater experience
in the operations of the field, and the intrigues of the
cabinet, will be requisite, in order to enable me to speak
with judgment upon these subjects. But, notwithstanding of
these flattering ideas of futurity, as well as the present
charms of variety, I must confess that I left home with
infinite regret, where I had treasured up stores of study and
plans of thinking for many years. I am sure I shall not be so
happy as I should have been had I prosecuted these. But, in
certain situations, a man dares not follow his own judgment or
refuse such offers as these.</p>

<p><!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_237" id="Page_v1_237">[237]</a></span>"The subscriptions for the stocks were filled up with
wonderful quickness this year; but, as the ministry had made
no private bargains with stock-jobbers, but opened books for
every body, these money-dealers have clogged the wheels a
little, and the subscribers find themselves losers on the
disposal of their stock, to their great surprise.</p>

<p>"There was a controverted election, that has made some noise,
betwixt John Pitt and Mr. Drax of the Prince's family, when
Mr. Pelham, finding himself under a necessity of disobliging
the heir-apparent, resolved to have others as deep in the
scrape as himself; and accordingly obliged Fox, Pitt,
Lyttelton, and Hume Campbell, all to speak on the same side.
They say their speeches were very diverting. An ass could not
mumble a thistle more ridiculously than they handled this
subject. Particularly our countryman, not being prepared, was
not able to speak a word to the subject, but spent half an
hour in protestations of his own integrity, disinterestedness,
and regard to every man's right and property.</p>

<p>"His brother, Lord Marchmont, has had the most extraordinary
adventure in the world. About three weeks ago he was at the
play, where he espied in one of the boxes a fair virgin, whose
looks, air, and manner, made such a powerful and wonderful
effect upon him as was visible to every bystander. His
raptures were so undisguised, his looks so expressive of
passion, his inquiries so earnest, that every body took notice
of it. He soon was told that her name was Crompton, a
linen-draper's daughter, that had been bankrupt last year, and
had not been able to pay above five shillings in the pound.
The fair nymph herself was about sixteen or seventeen, and
being supported by some relations, appeared in every <!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_238" id="Page_v1_238">[238]</a></span>public
place, and had fatigued every eye but that of his Lordship,
which, being entirely employed in the severer studies, had
never till that fatal moment opened upon her charms. Such and
so powerful was their effect, as to be able to justify all the
Pharamonds and Cyruses in their utmost extravagancies. He
wrote next morning to her father, desiring leave to visit his
daughter on honourable terms; and in a few days she will be
Countess of Marchmont.<a name="FNanchor_238:1_136" id="FNanchor_238:1_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_238:1_136" class="fnanchor">[238:1]</a> All this is certainly true. They
say many small fevers prevent a great one. Heaven be praised
that I have always liked the persons and company of the fair
sex! for by that means I hope to escape such ridiculous
passions. But could you ever suspect the ambitious, the
severe, the bustling, the impetuous, the violent Marchmont, of
becoming so tender and gentle a swain&mdash;an Artamenes, an
Oroondates?</p>

<p>"The officers, (I suppose from effeminacy,) are generally much
disgusted at the service. They speak of no less than three
hundred, high and low, who have desired leave to sell out. I
am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_238:2_137" id="FNanchor_238:2_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_238:2_137" class="fnanchor">[238:2]</a></p>

<p class="datelineit">"London, January 29, 1748."</p>
</div>


<p>On the same occasion he writes the following short letter to Henry Home.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"London, Feb. 9. 1748.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The doubt and ambiguity with which I came hither
was soon removed. General St. Clair positively refused to
accept of a secretary from the <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_239" id="Page_v1_239">[239]</a></span>ministry; and I go along with
him in the same station as before. Every body congratulates me
upon the pleasure I am to reap from this jaunt: and really I
have little to oppose to this prepossession, except an inward
reluctance to leave my books, and leisure and retreat.
However, I am glad to find this passion still so fresh and
entire; and am sure, by its means, to pass my latter days
happily and cheerfully, whatever fortune may attend me.</p>

<p>"I leave here two works going on: a new edition of my Essays,
all of which you have seen, except one, 'Of the Protestant
Succession,' where I treat that subject as coolly and
indifferently as I would the dispute between Cæsar and Pompey.
The conclusion shows me a Whig, but a very sceptical one. Some
people would frighten me with the consequences that may attend
this candour, considering my present station; but I own I
cannot apprehend any thing.</p>

<p>"The other work is the 'Philosophical Essays,' which you
dissuaded me from printing. I won't justify the prudence of
this step, any other way than by expressing my indifference
about all the consequences that may follow. I will expect to
hear from you; as you may from me. Remember me to Mrs. Home,
and believe me to be yours most sincerely.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;We set out on Friday next for Harwich."<a name="FNanchor_239:1_138" id="FNanchor_239:1_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_239:1_138" class="fnanchor">[239:1]</a></p>

<p>Of his second appointment under General St. Clair, on the duties of
which he entered at the beginning of the year 1748, Hume thus speaks in
his "own life," after having mentioned the descent on the coast of
France,&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Next year, to wit, 1747, I received an invitation <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_240" id="Page_v1_240">[240]</a></span>from the
General to attend him in the same station in his military
embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I then wore the
uniform of an officer, and was introduced at these courts as
aid-de-camp to the General, along with Sir Harry Erskine and
Captain Grant, now General Grant. These two years were almost
the only interruptions which my studies have received during
the course of my life. I passed them agreeably, and in good
company; and my appointments, with my frugality, had made me
reach a fortune, which I called independent, though most of my
friends were inclined to smile when I said so: in short, I was
now master of near a thousand pounds."</p>

observations on this occasion, in a pretty minute journal which he
transmitted to his brother, for the amusement of his family at
home.<a name="FNanchor_240:1_139" id="FNanchor_240:1_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_240:1_139" class="fnanchor">[240:1]</a> It requires no farther introduction, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Hague, 3d March, 1748, N. S.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I have taken a fancy, for your amusement, to
write a sort of journal of our travels, and to send you the
whole from Turin, by a messenger whom we are to despatch from
thence. I shall endeavour to find little snatches of leisure
in the several towns through which we shall pass, and shall
give you an account of the appearances of things, more than of
our own adventures. The former may be some entertainment, but
the other will in all probability contain little diversity, at
least for some time.</p>

<p>"We set out from Harwich the day I wrote you <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_241" id="Page_v1_241">[241]</a></span>last, and in
twenty-four hours arrived at Helvoet-Sluys. I had the
misfortune to be excessively sick, but the consolation to see
an admiral as sick as myself. 'Twas Admiral Forbes, the most
agreeable, sensible sea officer in England. Harwich and
Helvoet are the general images in abridgment of all the towns
in the two countries; both of them small sea-port towns,
without much trade, or any support but passengers; yet the
industry, economy, and cleanliness of the Dutch, have made the
latter the much prettier town. The day of our arrival we lay
at Rotterdam, and passed through the Brill and Maeslan-Sluys.
Yesterday we lay at this place. Holland has the beauties of
novelty to a stranger, as being so much different from all the
other parts of the world; but not those of diversity, for
every part of it is like another. 'Tis an unbounded plain,
divided by canals, and ditches, and rivers. The sea higher
than the country, the towns higher than the sea, and the
ramparts higher than the towns. The country is in general
pretty open, except a few willow trees, and the avenues of
elm, which lead to their towns, and shade the ramparts. But
the country is at present covered with snow, so that it is
difficult to judge of it. Were the season favourable, the way
of travelling would be very pleasant, being along the dykes,
which gives you a perfect prospect of the whole country. I
need not describe the beauty and elegance of the Dutch towns,
particularly of the Hague, which nothing can exceed. Rotterdam
is also a handsome town. The mixture of houses, trees, and
ships, has a fine effect, and unites town, country, and sea,
in one prospect. Every person and every house has the
appearance of plenty and sobriety, of industry and ease. I
own, however, that the outside of their houses are the best;
they are <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_242" id="Page_v1_242">[242]</a></span>too slight, full of bad windows, and not very well
contrived."</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Hague, 10th March.</p>

<p>"The General intended to have left this place to-day, but was
detained by the arrival of his Royal Highness,<a name="FNanchor_242:1_140" id="FNanchor_242:1_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_242:1_140" class="fnanchor">[242:1]</a> which
will retard him a day or two longer. We go first to Breda,
where the General's two battalions lie, out of which he will
endeavour to form one good healthy battalion to remain here.
The other returns to Scotland. We go in a day or two. The
Prince of Orange's authority seems firmly established, and for
the present is as absolute as that of any king in Europe; the
favour of the people is the foundation of it.<a name="FNanchor_242:2_141" id="FNanchor_242:2_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_242:2_141" class="fnanchor">[242:2]</a> He is
certainly a man of great humanity and moderation, but his
courage and capacity is perhaps a little more doubtful. The
present emergencies have given him an opportunity of
establishing his authority on a firmer bottom than popular
favour; viz. on foreign and mercenary forces. The Dutch troops
have behaved so ill, that the people themselves are willing to
see them disgraced, and discredited, and broke; so that the
prince has been able to make great distinctions in favour of
foreigners, with the good will of the people, who see the
necessity of it.</p>

<p>"He has broke all the Dutch troops that were prisoners in
France, but keeps up the foreigners that were in the same
condition; and the latter are chiefly encouraged in every
thing. Great and universal joy appeared on the birth of the
young prince while we were there, though all the arrangements
were taken <!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_243" id="Page_v1_243">[243]</a></span>to have the young princess succeed, and
particularly, she was named colonel of a regiment of guards.</p>

<p>"This is a place of little or no amusement, nor has the court
made much difference in this respect. No balls, no comedy, no
opera. The prince gives great application to business, which,
however, they pretend does not advance very much. But this we
may venture to say, that Holland was undoubtedly ruined by its
liberty, and has now a chance of being saved by its prince.
Let republicans make the best of this example they can.</p>

<p>"'Tis here regarded as a point indisputable, that the old
governors were in concert with the French, and were resolved,
by delivering up town after town, and army after army, to have
peace, though at the price of slavery and dependence. 'Tis a
pity that the scrupulous and conscientious character of the
prince has not allowed him to make some examples of these
rascals, against whom, 'tis said, there could have been legal
proofs. It was not the mob, properly speaking, that made the
revolution, but the middling and substantial tradesmen. At
Rotterdam particularly, these sent a regular deputation to the
magistrates, requiring the establishment of the Prince of
Orange, telling them, at the same time, that if their request
was refused, they could no longer answer for the mob. This
hint was sufficiently understood, and gave an example to all
the other towns in the province.</p>

<p>"The only violence offered, was that of throwing into the
canals whoever wore not Orange ribbons. Every yellow rag,
woollen, silk, and linen, were employed; and when these were
exhausted, the flowers were made use of; and happily the
revolution began in the spring, when the primroses and
daffodillys could serve as Orange cockades. To this day,
every <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_244" id="Page_v1_244">[244]</a></span>boor, and tradesman, and schoolboy, wears the ensigns
of the prince; and every street in every village, as well as
in every town, has triumphal arches with emblematical figures
and Latin inscriptions, such as, '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tandem justitia triumphat</span>,'
'<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Novus ab integro sæclorum nascitur ordo</span>,' '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vox populi, vox
Dei</span>.' I shall only say, if this last motto be true, the Prince
of Orange is the only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jure divino</i> monarch in the universe. I
believe, since the time of Germanicus, deservedly the darling
of the Romans, never was a people so fond of one man; surely
there entered not the smallest intrigue of his own into his
election. There is something of innocence and simplicity in
his character, which promotes more his popularity than the
greatest capacity. But,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Breda, 16th March.</p>

<p>"We arrived here the day before yesterday, in three days from
the Hague, and as the snows were then melted, after the most
violent frost in the world, we discovered Holland in all its
native deformity. Nothing can be more disagreeable than that
heap of dirt, and mud, and ditches, and reeds, which they here
call a country, except the silly collection of shells and
clipped evergreens which they call a garden. It gave us a
sensible pleasure, as we came near Breda, to find ourselves on
a dry barren heath, and to see something like a human
habitation. I have heard that a man, from the aspect of
Holland, would imagine that land and water, after many
struggles which should be master of it, had at last agreed to
share it betwixt them. If so, the land has come by much the
worst bargain, and has much the smallest share of the
possession. I am told, however, that Holland is a pleasant
<!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_245" id="Page_v1_245">[245]</a></span>enough habitation in the summer: though even that beauty lasts
a very short time; for, during the latter end of summer and
during the harvest, the canals send forth so disagreeable and
unwholesome a smell, that there is no enduring of it.</p>

<p>"We passed over the Maese at Gorcum, where it is above half a
mile broad; and as the ice had been softened by a thaw of
three or four days, we were obliged to make use of an ice
boat. The operation is after this manner: you place yourself
on your ice boat, which is like an ordinary boat, except only
that it runs upon two keels, shod with iron. Three or four men
push you along in this boat, very cleverly, as long as the ice
will bear you: but whenever that fails, plump down you go into
the water of a sudden. You are very heartily frightened. The
men are wet, up to the neck sometimes; but, keeping hold of
the boat, leap in, row you through the water, till they come
to ice which can bear. There they pull you up, run along with
you, till you sink again; and so they renew the same
operation.</p>

<p>"At Gorcum we met with Drumlanrig's regiment, which does no
great honour to their country by their looks and appearances.
There has been a mutiny amongst them, out of discontent to the
country. We met with some Highlanders, who regretted extremely
their native hills.</p>

<p>"The night we came to Breda we supped with Lord Albemarle, who
told us, in entering, that we might soon expect to hear of a
battle in the neighbourhood; and accordingly, in about an
hour, a messenger came in with the news, which is the best we
have had in the Low Countries during the whole war. You have
no doubt heard of it. It was the attack of a convoy to
Bergen-op-Zoom, escorted <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_246" id="Page_v1_246">[246]</a></span>by about 5000 French, where 400 were
killed, and about 1000 taken prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_246:1_142" id="FNanchor_246:1_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_246:1_142" class="fnanchor">[246:1]</a> Next day, the
prisoners were led through the town. They were the piquets of
several old regiments, and some companies of grenadiers; but
such pitiful-looking fellows never man set eye on. France is
surely much exhausted of men, when she can fill her armies
with such poor wretches. We all said, when they passed along,
are these the people that have beat us so often?</p>

<p>"I stood behind Lord Albemarle, who was looking over a low
window to see them. One of the ragged scarecrows, seeing his
lordship's star and ribbon, turned about to him, and said very
briskly, '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aujourd'hui pour vous, Monsieur, demain pour le
roi</span>.' If they have all this spirit, no wonder they beat us.
However, when one compares to the French the figures of men
that are in this town, British, Hessians, and Austrians, they
seem almost of a different species. Their officers expect they
will all do much better after having had leisure to see their
enemy. Breda is a strong town, though not near so strong as
Bergen-op-zoom. It is almost surrounded by water, and
inaccessible except in one place, by which it will be taken,
if the 206,000 men, whom we are to have in the field this
year, in the Low Countries, cannot save it. 'Tis certain so
many men are stipulated by the several powers,&mdash;the greatest
army that ever was assembled together in the world, since the
Xerxeses and Artaxerxeses; if these could be called armies.
God prosper his royal highness, and give him what he only
wants; I mean good fortune, to second his prudence and
conduct.</p>

<p>"The French certainly have laid their account to <!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_247" id="Page_v1_247">[247]</a></span>give up
Flanders by the peace; they squeeze, and oppress, and tax and
abuse the Flemings so much, that 'tis evident they consider
them not as subjects. They are also said to be pretty heartily
tired of the war, notwithstanding of their great successes. I
suppose the loss of their trade pinches them; so that there
are some hopes of a peace, which may not be altogether
intolerable. By the conversation I have had with several
judicious officers, I find that Mareschal Saxe and Lowendahl,
though sensible men and of great experience, are not regarded
as such mighty generals as we are apt to imagine them at a
distance, from their victories and conquests. Their blunders
last campaign were many and obvious, and particularly that of
besieging Bergen-op-zoom. 'Twas a thousand to one they got it,
and it serves them to no purpose when they have it: It is not
by that quarter they can penetrate into the Provinces."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Nimeguen, 20th March.</p>

<p>"We have come from Breda in two days, and lay last night at
Bois-le-duc, which is situated in the midst of a lake, and is
absolutely impregnable. That part of Brabant, through which we
travelled, is not very fertile, and is full of sandy heaths.
Nimeguen is in the Gueldre, the pleasantest province of the
seven, perhaps of the seventeen. The land is beautifully
divided into heights and plains, and is cut by the branches of
the Rhine. Nimeguen has a very commanding prospect, and the
country below it is particularly remarkable at present because
of the innundation of the Wahal, a branch of the Rhine, which
covers the whole fields for several leagues; and you see
nothing but the tops of trees standing up amidst the waters,
which recalls the idea of Egypt during the <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_248" id="Page_v1_248">[248]</a></span>inundations of the
Nile. Nimeguen is a well-built town, not very strong, though
surrounded with a great many works. Here we met our machines,
which came hither by a shorter road from the Hague. They are a
berline for the general and his company, and a chaise for the
servants. We set out to-morrow, and pass by Cologne,
Frankfort, and Ratisbon, till we meet with the Danube, and
then we sail down that river for two hundred and fifty miles
to Vienna.</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Cologne, 23d March.</p>

<p>"We came hither last night, and have travelled through an
extreme pleasant country along the banks of the Rhine.
Particularly Cleves, which belongs to the King of Prussia, is
very agreeable, because of the beauty of the roads, which are
avenues bordered with fine trees. The land in that province is
not fertile, but is well cultivated. The bishoprick of Cologne
is more fertile and adorned with fine woods as well as Cleves.
The country is all very populous, the houses good, and the
inhabitants well clothed and well fed. This is one of the
largest cities in Europe, being near a league in diameter. The
houses are all high; and there is no interval of gardens or
fields. So that you would expect it must be very populous. But
it is not so. It is extremely decayed, and is even falling to
ruin. Nothing can strike one with more melancholy than its
appearance, where there are marks of past opulence and
grandeur, but such present waste and decay, as if it had
lately escaped a pestilence or famine. We are told, that it
was formerly the centre of all the trade of the Rhine, which
has been since removed to Holland, Liege, Frankfort, &amp;c. Here
we see the Rhine in its natural state; being only a little
higher (but no broader) on account of the <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_249" id="Page_v1_249">[249]</a></span>melting of the
snows. I think it is as broad as from the foot of your house
to the opposite banks of the river."</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Bonne, 24th March.</p>

<p>"This is about six leagues from Cologne, a pleasant well-built
little town, upon the banks of the Rhine, and is the seat of
the archbishop. We have bestowed half a day in visiting his
palace, which is an extensive magnificent building; and he is
certainly the best lodged prince in Europe except the King of
France. For, besides this palace, and a sort of Maison de
Plaisance near it, (the most elegant thing in the world,) he
has also two country houses very magnificent. He is the late
emperor's brother; and is, as they say, a very fine
gentleman;&mdash;a man of pleasure, very gallant and gay; he has
always at his court a company of French comedians and Italian
singers. And as he always keeps out of wars, being protected
by the sacredness of his character, he has nothing to hope and
nothing to fear; and seems to be the happiest prince in
Europe. However, we could wish he took a little more care of
his high-ways, even though his furniture, pictures, and
building were a little less elegant. We are got into a country
where we have no fires but stoves; and no covering but feather
beds; neither of which I like, both of them are too warm and
suffocating."</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Coblentz, 26th March.</p>

<p>"We have made the pleasantest journey in the world in two days
from Bonne to this town. We travel all along the banks of the
Rhine; sometimes in open, beautiful, well-cultivated plains;
at another time sunk betwixt high mountains, which are only
divided by the <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_250" id="Page_v1_250">[250]</a></span>Rhine, the finest river in the world. One of
these mountains is always covered with wood to the top; the
other with vines; and the mountain is so steep that they are
obliged to support the earth by walls, which rise one above
another like terraces to the length of forty or fifty stories.
Every quarter of a mile, (indeed as often as there is any flat
bottom for a foundation,) you meet with a handsome village,
situated in the most romantic manner in the world. Surely
there never was such an assemblage of the wild and cultivated
beauties in one scene. There are also several magnificent
convents and palaces to embellish the prospects.</p>

<p>"This is a very thriving well-built town, situated at the
confluence of the Moselle and the Rhine, and consequently very
finely situated. Over the former river there is a handsome
stone bridge; over the latter a flying bridge, which is a boat
fixed by a chain: this chain is fixed by an anchor to the
bottom of the middle of the river far above, and is supported
by seven little boats placed at intervals that keep it along
the surface of the water. By means of the rudder, they turn
the head of the large boat to the opposite bank, and the
current of the river carries it over of itself. It goes over
in about four minutes, and will carry four or five hundred
people. It stays about five or six minutes and then returns.
Two men are sufficient to guide it, and it is certainly a very
pretty machine. There is the like at Cologne. This town is the
common residence of the Archbishop of Treves, who has here a
pretty magnificent palace. We have now travelled along a great
part of that country, through which the Duke of Marlborough
marched up his army, when he led them into Bavaria. 'Tis of
this country Mr. Addison speaks when he calls the people&mdash;</p>

</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Frankfort, 28th March.</p>

<p>"Our road from Coblentz to this passes through a great many
princes' territories; Nassau's, Hesse's, Baden's, Mentz, and
this Republic, &amp;c. and there is as great a diversity in the
nature of the country. The first part of the road from
Coblentz to Weis-Baden is very mountainous and woody, but
populous and well-cultivated. In many places the snow is lying
very thick. The road is disagreeable for a coach; sometimes
you go along the side of a hill with a precipice below you,
and have not an inch to spare; and the road hanging all the
way towards the precipice, so that one had need to have a good
head to look out of the windows. Nassau, the prince of
Orange's capital, is but a village, and one of the most
indifferent I have seen in Germany. Betwixt Weis-Baden and
Frankfort we travel along the banks of the Maine, and see one
of the finest plains in the world. I never saw such rich soil
nor better cultivated; all in corn and sown grass. For we have
not met with any natural grass in Germany.</p>

<p>"Frankfort is a very large town, well-built and of <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_252" id="Page_v1_252">[252]</a></span>great
riches and commerce. Around it there are several little
country houses of the citizens, the first of that kind we have
seen in Germany; for every body, except the farmers, live in
towns, and these dwell all in villages. Whether this be for
company or protection, or devotion, I cannot tell. But it has
certainly its inconveniences. Princes have also seats in the
country, and monks have their convents; but no private
gentleman ever dwells there. To-morrow we pass over the field
of Dettingen. We saw Heighst [<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Höchst</span>] to-day, where Lord Stair
past the Maine, and was recalled. The post he took seems not
so good as we have heard it represented. We saw General
Mordaunt at Cologne, who was at the battle of Dettingen, and
gave us an exact description of the whole, which we are
to-morrow to compare with the field. Frankfort is a Protestant
town."</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Wurtzburg, 30th March.</p>

<p>"The first town we come to after leaving Frankfort is Hanau,
which belongs to the Landgrave of Hesse, and where there is a
palace, that may lodge any king in Europe, though the
Landgrave never almost lives there. Hanau is a very beautiful,
well-built, but not large town, on the banks of the Maine. All
the houses almost in Germany are of plaster, either upon brick
or wood, but very neatly done, and many of them painted over,
which makes them look very gay. Their peasants' houses are
sometimes plaster, sometimes clay upon wood, two stories high,
and look very well.</p>

<p>"Next post beyond Hanau is the village of Dettingen, where we
walked out and surveyed the field of battle,<a name="FNanchor_252:1_143" id="FNanchor_252:1_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_252:1_143" class="fnanchor">[252:1]</a>
<!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_253" id="Page_v1_253">[253]</a></span>accompanied with the postmaster, who saw the battle from his
windows. Good God, what an escape we made there! The Maine is
a large river not fordable; this lay on our left hand. On our
right, high mountains covered with thick wood, for several
leagues. The plain is not half a mile broad. The French were
posted by Noailles with their right supported by the river and
the village of Dettingen; their left by the mountains; on
their front a little rivulet, which formed some marshes and
meadows altogether impassable for the cavalry, and passable
with difficulty by the infantry. Add to this, that their
cannon, played in safety on the other side of the Maine, raked
the whole plain before Dettingen, and took our army in flank.
Noailles had past the bridge of Aschaffenbourg which was not
broke down, and came up upon our rear; and our army was
starving for want of provisions.</p>

<p>"Such an arrangement of circumstances, as it were contrived to
ruin an army, a king and kingdom, never was before found in
the world; and yet there we gained a victory, by the folly of
Grammont, who past that rivulet, and met us in the open plain,
before Noailles had come up. We were travelling in great
security, notwithstanding two repeated informations that the
French had past the Maine; the baggage of the army was betwixt
the two lines; and when the first cannons were fired, Neuperg
and Stair both agreed that it could be nothing but the French
signal guns. But when they were certain that the affair was
more in earnest, Stair said, 'Go to the king; I take nothing
upon me.' Clayton said, 'I will take it upon me, to remove the
baggage.' And it was he that made the little disposition that
was made that day. The English behaved ill: the French worse,
which gave us <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_254" id="Page_v1_254">[254]</a></span>the victory. But this victory so unexpectedly
gained, we pushed not as we ought, by the counsel of Neuperg.
What Lord Stair's whim was to advance to Aschaffenbourg, where
he was twenty-five miles from Frankfort, the place of all his
magazines, 'tis impossible to imagine. Surely he could advance
no farther, as he must have been convinced had he reconnoitred
the road. It runs over high mountains, and for twenty-five
miles through the thickest woods in the world.</p>

<p>"There is a pass three or four miles beyond Aschaffenbourg,
where no army could go with cannon and baggage. When we<a name="FNanchor_254:1_144" id="FNanchor_254:1_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_254:1_144" class="fnanchor">[254:1]</a>
came to the foot of it a trumpeter met us, who played a tune
for joy of our safe arrival; and the like on our ascending the
opposite hill. The woods beyond are the finest I ever saw.
Wurtzburg is a very well-built town, situated in a fine valley
on the Maine. The banks of the river are very high, and
covered with vines. The river runs through the town, and is
passed on a very handsome bridge. But what renders this town
chiefly remarkable, is a building which surprised us all,
because we had never before heard of it, and did not there
expect to meet with such a thing. 'Tis a prodigious
magnificent palace of the bishop who is the sovereign. 'Tis
all of hewn stone and of the richest architecture. I do think
the king of France has not such a house. If it be less than
Versailles, 'tis more complete and finished. What a surprising
thing it is, that these petty princes can build such palaces:
but it has been fifty years a rearing; and 'tis the chief
expense of ecclesiastics. The bishop of Wurtzburg is chosen
from amongst the canons, who have a very good artifice <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_255" id="Page_v1_255">[255]</a></span>to
exclude princes. 'Tis a rule, that every one at entering shall
receive a very hearty drubbing from the rest: the brother of
the elector of Bavaria offered a million of florins, to be
exempted from the ceremony, and could not prevail."</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Ratisbon, 2d April.</p>

<p>"We were all very much taken with the town of Nuremberg, where
we lay two nights ago; the houses, though old-fashioned, and
of a grotesque figure, (having sometimes five or six stories
of garrets,) yet are they solid, well built, complete, and
cleanly. The people are handsome, well clothed, and well fed;
an air of industry and contentment, without splendour,
prevails through the whole. 'Tis a Protestant republic on the
banks of a river, (whose name I have forgot,<a name="FNanchor_255:1_145" id="FNanchor_255:1_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_255:1_145" class="fnanchor">[255:1]</a>) that runs
into the Maine, and is navigable for boats. The town is of a
large extent. On leaving Nuremberg we entered into the elector
of Bavaria's country, where the contrast appeared very strong
with the inhabitants of the former republic. There was a great
air of poverty in every face; the first poverty indeed we had
seen in Germany. We travelled also through part of the elector
Palatine's country, and then returned to Bavaria; but though
the country be good and well cultivated, and populous, the
inhabitants are not at their ease. The late miserable wars
have no doubt hurt them much. Ratisbon is a catholic republic
situated on the banks of the Danube. The houses and buildings,
and aspect of the people, are well enough, though not
comparable to those of Nuremberg. 'Tis pretended that the
difference is always sensible betwixt a Protestant and
Catholic country, throughout all Germany; and perhaps there
may be <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_256" id="Page_v1_256">[256]</a></span>something in this observation, though it is not every
where sensible.</p>

<p>"We descend the Danube from this to Vienna; we go in a large
boat about eighty foot long, where we have three rooms, one
for ourselves, a second for the servants, and a third for our
kitchen. 'Tis made entirely of fir boards, and is pulled to
pieces at Vienna, the wood sold, and the watermen return to
Ratisbon a-foot. We lie on shore every night. We are all glad
of this variety, being a little tired of our berline."</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"The Danube, 7th of April.</p>

<p>"We have really made a very pleasant journey, or rather
voyage, with good weather, sitting at our ease, and having a
variety of scenes continually presented to us, and immediately
shifted, as it were in an opera. The banks of the Danube are
very wild and savage, and have a very different beauty from
those of the Rhine; being commonly high scraggy precipices,
covered all with firs. The water is sometimes so straitened
betwixt these mountains, that this immense river is often not
sixty foot broad. We have lain in and seen several very good
towns in Bavaria and Austria, such as Strauburg, Passau,
Lintz; but what is most remarkable is the great magnificence
of some convents, particularly Moelk, where a set of lazy
rascals of monks live in the most splendid misery of the
world; for, generally speaking, their lives are as little to
be envied as their persons are to be esteemed.</p>

<p>"We enter Vienna in a few hours, and the country is here
extremely agreeable; the fine plains of the Danube began about
thirty miles above, and continued down, through Austria,
Hungary, &amp;c. till it falls into <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_257" id="Page_v1_257">[257]</a></span>the Black Sea. The river is
very magnificent. Thus we have finished a very agreeable
journey of 860 miles (for so far is Vienna from the Hague,)
have past through many a prince's territories, and have had
more masters than many of these princes have subjects. Germany
is undoubtedly a very fine country, full of industrious honest
people; and were it united, it would be the greatest power
that ever was in the world. The common people are here, almost
every where, much better treated, and more at their ease, than
in France; and are not very much inferior to the English,
notwithstanding all the airs the latter give themselves. There
are great advantages in travelling, and nothing serves more to
remove prejudices; for I confess I had entertained no such
advantageous idea of Germany; and it gives a man of humanity
pleasure to see that so considerable a part of mankind as the
Germans are in so tolerable a condition."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Vienna, 15th April.</p>

<p>"The last week was Easter week, and every body was at their
devotions, so that we saw not the court nor the emperor and
empress, till yesterday, when we were all introduced by Sir
Thomas Robinson.<a name="FNanchor_257:1_146" id="FNanchor_257:1_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_257:1_146" class="fnanchor">[257:1]</a> <!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_258" id="Page_v1_258">[258]</a></span>They are a well-looked couple, the
emperor has a great air of goodness, and his royal consort of
spirit. Her voice, and manner, and address are the most
agreeable that can be, and she made us several compliments on
our nation. She is not a beauty; but, being a sovereign, and a
woman of sense and spirit, no wonder she has met such
extraordinary support from her subjects, as well as from some
other nations of Europe. However, the English gallantry
towards her is a little relaxed; and the King of Sardinia is
their present favourite. She begged of the general not to be
so much her enemy as his predecessor, General Wentworth, had
been. He replied, that a perfect impartiality was recommended
him by the king, his master; and that he was resolved to
preserve it, though he confessed that was difficult for a
person who had had the honour of having had access to her
imperial majesty.</p>

<p>"We were introduced to-day to the archdukes and archduchesses
(who are fine children) and to the empress-dowager. She had
seen no company for two months; but, hearing that Englishmen
desired to be introduced to her, she immediately received us.
<!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_259" id="Page_v1_259">[259]</a></span>You must know that you neither bow nor kneel to emperors and
empresses, but curtsy; so that, after we had had a little
conversation with her imperial majesty, we were to walk
backwards through a very long room, curtsying all the way, and
there was very great danger of our falling foul of each other,
as well as of tumbling topsy-turvy. She saw the difficulty we
were in; and immediately called to us: '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allez, allez,
Messieurs, sans cérémonie; vous n'êtes pas accoutumés a ce
mouvement, et le plancher est glissant</span>.' We esteemed ourselves
very much obliged to her for this attention, especially my
companions, who were desperately afraid of my falling on them
and crushing them.</p>

<p>"This court is fine, without being gay; and the company is
very accessible, without being very sociable. When we were to
be introduced to the emperor and empress, Sir Thomas Robinson
gathered us all together into a window, that he might be able
to carry us to them at once, when the time should be proper. A
lady came up to him, and asked him if these were not his
chickens he was gathering under his wings, after which she
joined conversation with us; and in a little time asked us, if
we had any acquaintance of the ladies of the court, and if we
should not be glad to know their names. We replied that she
could not do us a greater favour. 'Why, then,' says she, 'I
shall tell you, beginning with myself; I am the Countess'&mdash;she
added her name, which I am sorry to have forgot. We have met
with several instances of these agreeable liberties. The women
here are many of them handsome; if you ever want toasts,
please to name, upon my authority, Mademoiselle Staremberg, or
the Countess Palfì.</p>

<p>"The men are ugly and awkward. We have seen <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_260" id="Page_v1_260">[260]</a></span>all those fierce
heroes, whom we have so often read of in gazettes, the
Lichtensteins, the Esterhasis, the Colloredos; most of them
have red heels to their shoes, and wear very well-dressed
toupees.</p>

<p>"I have heard Maly Johnston say she was told that she was very
like the empress-queen. Please tell her it is not so. The
empress, though not very well shaped, is better than Maly; but
she has not so good a face. She looks also as if she were
prouder and worse tempered. Apropos, to our friends of Hutton
hall, inform them that they have a very near relation at this
court, who is a prodigious fine gentleman, and a great fool.
His name is Sir James Caldwell.<a name="FNanchor_260:1_147" id="FNanchor_260:1_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_260:1_147" class="fnanchor">[260:1]</a> He told me his
grandmother was a Hume, and that he expected soon to inherit a
very fine estate by her, which he was to share with the
Johnstones <!-- Page 261 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_261" id="Page_v1_261">[261]</a></span>in Scotland. But he says it is only Wynne that has
the half, not the ladies, who have no share; so that you'll
please tell Sophy that I am off; and give her her liberty,
notwithstanding all vows and promises that may have past
betwixt us."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Vienna, 25th April.</p>

<p>"We set out to-morrow, but go not by the way of Venice, as we
at first proposed. This is some mortification to us. We shall
go, however, by Milan. This town is very little for a capital,
but excessively populous. The houses are very high, the
streets very narrow and crooked, so that the many handsome
buildings that are here, make not any figure. The suburbs are
spacious and open; but, on the whole, I can never believe what
they tell us, that there are two hundred thousand inhabitants
in it. It is composed entirely of nobility and of lackeys, of
soldiers and of priests. Now, I believe you'll allow, that in
a town inhabited only by these four sets of people
above-mentioned, the empress-queen could not have undertaken a
more difficult task, than that which she has magnanimously
entered upon, viz. the producing an absolute chastity amongst
them. A court of chastity is lately erected here, who send all
loose women to the frontiers of Hungary, where they can only
debauch Turks and Infidels. I hope you will not pay your taxes
with greater grudge, because you hear that her imperial
majesty, in whose service they are to be spent, is so great a
prude.</p>

<p>"There has been great noise made with us on account of the
queen's new palace at <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schönbrunn</span>. <!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_262" id="Page_v1_262">[262]</a></span>It is, indeed, a handsome
house, but not very great nor richly furnished. She said to
the general last night, that not a single soldier had gone to
the building, whatever might be said in England, but that she
liked better to be tolerably lodged than to have useless
diamonds by her; and that she had sold all her crown jewels to
enable her to be at that expense. I think, for a sovereign,
she is none of the worst in Europe, and one cannot forbear
liking her for the spirit with which she looks, and speaks,
and acts. But 'tis a pity her ministers have so little sense.</p>

<p>"Prince Eugene's palace in the suburbs is an expensive stately
building, but of a very barbarous Gothic taste. He was <em>more
skilled in battering walls than building</em>, as was said of his
friend, the Duke of Marlborough. There is a room in it, where
all Prince Eugene's battles were painted: upon which the
Portuguese ambassador told him, that the whole house was
indeed richly furnished, but that all the kings in Europe
could not furnish such a room as that. I have been pretty busy
since I came here, and have regretted it the less that there
is no very great amusement in this place. No Italian opera; no
French comedy; no dancing. I have, however, heard Monticelli,
who is the next wonder of the world to Farinelli."</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Knittelfeldt in Styria, 28th April.</p>

<p>"This is about a hundred and twenty miles from Vienna. The
first forty is a fine well-cultivated plain, after which we
enter the mountains; and, as we are told, we have three
hundred miles more of them before we reach the plains of
Lombardy. The way of travelling through a mountainous country
is generally very agreeable. We are obliged to trace the
course of the rivers, and are always in a pretty <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_263" id="Page_v1_263">[263]</a></span>valley
surrounded by high hills; and have a constant and very quick
succession of wild agreeable prospects every quarter of a
mile. Through Styria nothing can be more curious than the
scenes. In the valleys, which are fertile and finely
cultivated, there is at present a full bloom of spring. The
hills to a certain height are covered with firs and larch
trees, the tops are all shining with snow. You may see a tree
white with blossom, and, fifty fathom farther up, the ground
white with snow. These hills, as you may imagine, give a great
command of water to the valleys, which the industrious
inhabitants distribute into every field, and render the whole
very fertile. There are many iron mines in the country, and
the valleys are upon that account extremely populous. But as
much as the country is agreeable in its wildness, as much are
the inhabitants savage, and deformed, and monstrous in their
appearance. Very many of them have ugly swelled throats;
idiots and deaf people swarm in every village; and the general
aspect of the people is the most shocking I ever saw. One
would think, that as this was the great road, through which
all the barbarous nations made their irruptions into the Roman
empire, they always left here the refuse of their armies
before they entered into the enemy's country, and that from
thence the present inhabitants are descended. Their dress is
scarce European, as their figure is scarce human.</p>

<p>"There happened, however, a thing to-day, which surprised us
all. The empress-queen, regarding this country as a little
barbarous, has sent some missionaries of Jesuits to instruct
them. They had sermons to-day in the street, under our
windows, attended with psalms; and believe me, nothing could
be more <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_264" id="Page_v1_264">[264]</a></span>harmonious, better tuned, or more agreeable than the
voices of these savages; and the chorus of a French opera does
not sing in better time. You may infer from thence, if you
please, that Orpheus did not civilize the savage nations by
his music. I know not what progress the Jesuits have made by
their eloquence; but it appears to me that religion is not the
point in which the Styrians are defective, at least if we may
judge by the number of their churches, crucifixes, &amp;c. We
shall be detained here some days by Sir Harry Erskine's
illness, who is seized with an ague."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Clagenfurt in Carinthia, May 4.</p>

<p>"This is a mighty pretty little town, near the Drave. It is
the capital of the province, and stands in a tolerable large
plain, surrounded with very high hills; and on the other side
the Drave we see the savage Mountains of Carniola. You know
the Alps join with the Pyrenees, these with the Alps,<a name="FNanchor_264:1_148" id="FNanchor_264:1_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_264:1_148" class="fnanchor">[264:1]</a>

<p class="letterdateit">"Trent, 8th of May.</p>

<p>"We are still amongst mountains, and follow the tract of
rivers in order to find our way. But the aspect of the people
is wonderfully changed on entering the Tyrol. The inhabitants
are there as remarkably beautiful as the Styrians are ugly. An
air of humanity, and spirit, and health, and plenty, is seen
in every face. Yet their country is wilder than Styria, the
hills higher, and the valleys narrower and <!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_265" id="Page_v1_265">[265]</a></span>more barren. They
are both Germans, subject to the house of Austria; so that it
would puzzle a naturalist or politician to find the reason of
so great and remarkable a difference. We traced up the Drave
to its source: (that river, you know, falls into the Danube,
and into the Black Sea.) It ended in a small rivulet, and that
in a ditch, and then in a little bog. On the top of the hill
(though there was there a well cultivated plain) there was no
more appearance of spring than at Christmas. In about half a
mile after we had seen the Drave extinguish, we observed a
little stripe of water to move. This was the beginning of the
Adige, and the rivers that run into the Adriatic. We were now
turning toward the south part of the hill, and descended with
great rapidity. Our little brook in three or four miles became
a considerable river, and every hour's travelling showed us a
new aspect of spring; so that in one day we passed through all
the gradations of that beautiful season, as we descended lower
into the valleys, from its first faint dawn till its full
bloom and glory. We are here in Italy; at least the common
language of the people is Italian. This town is not remarkable
neither for size nor beauty. 'Tis only famous for that wise
assembly of philosophers and divines, who established such
rational tenets for the belief of mankind."</p>

<p>Far different was the pomp and circumstance in which the writer of this
narrative performed his <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_267" id="Page_v1_267">[267]</a></span>journey, from the condition in which Goldsmith,

</div>

<p>And Hume's motions seem to have partaken of the pomp and regularity of
his official station; for, even in these familiar letters to his
brother, he is all along the secretary of legation; or when he descends
from that height, it is but to mount the chair of the scholar and
philosopher. There are no escapades. We never hear that he has taken it
in his head to diverge from the regular route to see an old castle or a
waterfall. Yet he went with an eye for scenery. The Alpine passes
excited his admiration, and his description of the banks of the Rhine
will be recognised at this day as very accurate&mdash;with one material
exception. He says nothing of the feudal fortresses perched like the
nests of birds of prey, to which their moral resemblance was at least as
close as their physical; and thus one of the greatest historians of his
age, passes through a country without appearing to have noticed in their
true character, this series of prominent marks of a remarkable chapter
in the history of Europe. He speaks of them simply as "palaces"&mdash;a word
not designative of the character of the buildings, or in any way
evincing that their historical position had occurred to his mind. But it
must be admitted, that later tourists on the Rhine have amply made up
for his silence on these matters.</p>

<p>He does not condescend to mention any one of the fine specimens of
Gothic architecture which he must have seen&mdash;not even that vast and
beautiful fragment the cathedral of Cologne. One wonders whether or not
he was at the trouble of inquiring, what was <!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_268" id="Page_v1_268">[268]</a></span>that huge mass which he
must have seen towering over the city; and if, straying within its
gates, and looking on Albert Durer's painted windows, he had curiosity
enough to inspect the reliquary of the tomb of the three kings,
containing gems so ancient, that they are conjectured to be older than
Christianity, and to have been the ornaments of some Pagan shrine,
transferred to and historically associated with the pure creed which
displaced the barbarous rites of Paganism. This might have at least
formed a curious topic for his Natural History of Religion. But on this
as on many other subjects, he would sympathize with La Bruyere when he
speaks of "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'ordre Gothique, que la barbarie avoit introduit pour les
palais et pour les temples</span>;" and his thorough neglect of both the
baronial and ecclesiastical architecture of the middle ages, is
characteristic of a mind which could find nothing worthy of admiration,
in the time which elapsed between the extinction of ancient classical
literature, and the rise of the arts and sciences in modern Europe.</p>

<p>But upon scarcely any subject does Hume converse as a brother travelling
into foreign lands might be supposed to address a brother residing at
home, and cultivating his ancestral acres. We should expect to find him
observing that this river is like the Tweed, or unlike it&mdash;larger or
smaller; or comparing some range of hills with the Cheviots: but he is
general and undomestic in all his remarks, save the one observation that
the Rhine is as broad as from his brother's house to the opposite side
of the river.</p>

<p>Until he comes to the land of Virgil, where he shows real enthusiasm,
the chief object of his interest and observation appears to have been
the warlike operations in the midst of which he found himself. <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_269" id="Page_v1_269">[269]</a></span>The
mission must have been attended with the ordinary dangers of a military
enterprise. It was undertaken at a time when all Europe was at war, and
though decisive battles were not taking place, petty conflicts and
surprises were of perpetual occurrence until the treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle, a few months afterwards, restored repose to the
exhausted nations. Yet we find no symptoms of anxiety in the mind of the
philosophical actor of the military character. His tone is generally
that of a private traveller in a peaceful country, rather than that of a
member of an expedition armed for defence, and likely to be called on to
defend itself. When he mentions warlike operations, he adopts the tone
of a historical critic, and never that of a person who may find his
personal safety or comfort compromised by them.</p>

<p>Though he seems to have set out with the too general notion that
military affairs are the main object of attention to the man who is
desirous of distinction in historical literature, we find already
dawning on him the historian's nobler duty as a delineator of the state
of society, and an inquirer into the causes of the happiness or misery
of the people. And his observations are made with a wide and generous
benevolence, strikingly at contrast with those prevailing doctrines of
his day, which sought, in the success and happiness of one country, the
elements of the misery of another, and made the good fortune of our
neighbours a source of lamentation, as indicating calamity to ourselves.
His unaffected declaration of pleasure, in finding the Germans so happy
and comfortable a people, marks a heart full of genuine kindness and
benevolence, and will more than atone for the want of a disposition to
range <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_270" id="Page_v1_270">[270]</a></span>through alpine scenery, or a taste to appreciate the beauties of
Gothic architecture.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Hume had intended to continue his journal, but no
farther trace of it has been found. The results of the mission have not
been generally noticed by historians. Its objects were of a subordinate
nature, and the occasion for attending to them was obviated by the
completion of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle on 7th October.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of Hume's residence in Turin, we have some notices by an able
observer, Lord Charlemont, the celebrated Irish political leader, who,
then in his twentieth year, was following the practice of the higher
aristocracy of his age, and endeavouring to enlarge his mind by foreign
travel. In the following probably exaggerated description it will be
seen that he was far mistaken in his estimate of Hume's age.</p>

<p>"With this extraordinary man I was intimately acquainted. He had kindly
distinguished me from among a number of young men, who were then at the
academy, and appeared so warmly attached to me, that it was apparent he
not only intended to honour me with his friendship, but to bestow on me
what was, in his opinion, the first of all favours and benefits, by
making me his convert and disciple.</p>

<p>"Nature, I believe, never formed any man more unlike his real character
than David Hume. The powers of physiognomy were baffled by his
countenance; neither could the most skilful in that science, pretend to
discover the smallest trace of the faculties of his mind, in the
unmeaning features of his visage. His face was broad and fat, his mouth
wide, and without any other expression than that of imbecility. His eyes
vacant and spiritless, and the corpulence of his <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_271" id="Page_v1_271">[271]</a></span>whole person, was far
better fitted to communicate the idea of a turtle-eating alderman, than
of a refined philosopher. His speech in English was rendered ridiculous
by the broadest Scotch accent, and his French was, if possible, still
more laughable; so that wisdom most certainly never disguised herself
before in so uncouth a garb. Though now near fifty years old, he was
healthy and strong; but his health and strength, far from being
advantageous to his figure, instead of manly comeliness, had only the
appearance of rusticity. His wearing an uniform added greatly to his
natural awkwardness, for he wore it like a grocer of the trained bands.
Sinclair was a lieutenant-general, and was sent to the courts of Vienna
and Turin, as a military envoy, to see that their quota of troops was
furnished by the Austrians and Piedmontese. It was therefore thought
necessary that his secretary should appear to be an officer, and Hume
was accordingly disguised in scarlet."<a name="FNanchor_271:1_150" id="FNanchor_271:1_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_271:1_150" class="fnanchor">[271:1]</a></p>

being addled; a history of the English Church music, and of the choir of
Carlisle in particular; a full account of the affair of 1745, with the
trials, last speeches, and so forth, of the poor <em>plaids</em> who were
strapped up at Carlisle; and lastly, a full and particular description
of Corby, with the genealogy of every family who ever possessed it? I
think, even without more than the usual waste of margin, the poems of
David would make a decent twelve shilling touch."</p>

recollection in the ordinary biographical dictionaries, but is still
familiar to the readers of the history of the period, was for some time
ambassador at Vienna, and was plenipotentiary from Britain at the treaty
of Aix La Chapelle in 1748. In 1754 he became secretary of state for a
few months. In 1761 he was raised to the peerage by the title of Baron
Grantham. "Sir Thomas," says Walpole, "had been bred in German courts,
and was rather restored than naturalized to the genius of that country;
he had German honour, loved German politics, and could explain himself
as little as if he spoke only German."&mdash;Memoires of George III. 337.
According to the same authority, he was subjected, on account of his
name, to an identification with Robinson Crusoe, something like that
with which Madame Talleyrand honoured Denon, owing to the accident of
his being a great traveller whose name ended in "on."</p>

<p>Sir T. Robinson was a tall uncouth man, and his stature was often
rendered still more remarkable by his hunting dress, a postilion's cap,
a tight green jacket, and buckskin breeches. He was liable to sudden
whims; and once set off on a sudden, in his hunting suit, to visit his
sister, who was married and settled at Paris. He arrived while there was
a large company at dinner. The servant announced Mr. Robinson, and he
came in, to the great amazement of the guests. Among others a French
abbé thrice lifted his fork to his mouth, and thrice laid it down, with
an eager stare of surprise. Unable to restrain his curiosity any longer,
he burst out with, "Excuse me, sir; are you the famous Robinson Crusoe
so remarkable in history."&mdash;Walpoliana.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_260:1_147" id="Footnote_260:1_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_260:1_147"><span class="label">[260:1]</span></a> An Irish baronet, grandson of Sir James Caldwell who
was created a baronet in 1683, and distinguished himself in the service
of William III. during the Irish revolutionary wars. The person
commemorated in so flattering a manner by Hume, rose to considerable
rank in the service of the empress, and was enabled to introduce to that
service a brother, who obtained in it far more distinction, and who, in
connexion with the relationship mentioned above, was called Hume
Caldwell. He seems to have been strongly endowed with the mercurial
disposition of his countrymen. On his first introduction to the service,
he "took expensive lodgings, kept a chariot, a running footman, and a
hussar, and was admitted into the highest circles;" the natural result
of which was, that, on preparing to join his regiment, when he paid his
debts, he found that he had just two gold ducats left; whereupon, as his
biographer pathetically narrates, "the companion of princes, the friend
of Count Conigsegg, the possessor of a splendid hotel and a gilt
chariot, who had kept a hussar and an opera girl, figured at court, and
had an audience of the empress, and was possessed of a letter of credit
for £1000, set out from Vienna alone, on foot, in a mean habit, and with
an empty pocket, for that army in which he was to rise by his merit to a
distinguished command." His subsequent history is a little romance. Mr.
Hume Caldwell, being lost sight of by the great world, is searched for
hither and thither, and at length an Irish private soldier being
questioned about the matter, turns out to be Caldwell himself, who is
immediately restored to his proper station.&mdash;Ryan's Worthies of
Ireland.</p>

<p class="section">Early in the year 1748, and while he was on his way to Turin, Hume's
"Philosophical Essays <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_272" id="Page_v1_272">[272]</a></span>concerning Human Understanding,"<a name="FNanchor_272:1_151" id="FNanchor_272:1_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:1_151" class="fnanchor">[272:1]</a> which he
afterwards styled "Inquiry concerning Human Understanding," were
published anonymously in London. The preparation of this work had
probably afforded him a much larger share of genuine pleasure, than
either the excitement of travelling, or the observation of the natural
scenery, the works of art, and the men and manners among which he moved.
In the tone of a true philosophical enthusiast, he says in the first
section of the work, "Were there no advantage to be reaped from these
studies beyond the gratification of an innocent curiosity, yet ought not
even this to be despised, as being an accession to those few safe and
harmless pleasures which are bestowed on the human race. The sweetest
and most inoffensive path of life leads through the avenues of science
and learning; and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this
way, or open up any new prospect, ought so far to be esteemed a
benefactor to mankind. And though these researches may appear painful
and fatiguing, it is with some minds as with some bodies, which being
endowed with vigorous and florid health, require <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_273" id="Page_v1_273">[273]</a></span>severe exercise, and
reap a pleasure from what, to the generality of mankind, may seem
burdensome and laborious."</p>

<p>On the publication of this work, he says in his "own life,"&mdash;"I had
always entertained a notion, that my want of success in publishing the
'Treatise of Human Nature,' had proceeded more from the manner than the
matter, and that I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in
going to the press too early. I, therefore, cast the first part of that
work anew in the 'Inquiry concerning Human Understanding,' which was
published while I was at Turin. But this piece was at first little more
successful than the 'Treatise of Human Nature.' On my return from Italy,
I had the mortification to find all England in a ferment, on account of
Dr. Middleton's 'Free Inquiry,'<a name="FNanchor_273:1_152" id="FNanchor_273:1_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_273:1_152" class="fnanchor">[273:1]</a> while my performance was entirely
overlooked and neglected."</p>

<p>He now desired that the "Treatise of Human Nature" should be treated as
a work blotted out of literature, and that the "Inquiry" should be
substituted in its place. In the subsequent editions of the latter work,
he complained that this had not been complied with; that the world still
looked at those forbidden volumes of which he had dictated the
suppression. "Henceforth," he says, "the author desires that the
following pieces may alone be regarded as containing his philosophical
principles and sentiments;" and he became eloquent on the uncandidness
of bringing before the <!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_274" id="Page_v1_274">[274]</a></span>world as the sentiments of any author, a work
written almost in boyhood, and printed at the threshold of manhood. But
it was all in vain: he had to learn that the world takes possession of
all that has passed through the gates of the printing press, and that
neither the command of despotic authority, nor the solicitations of
repentant authorship can reclaim it, if it be matter of sterling value.
The bold and original speculations of the "Treatise" have been, and to
all appearance ever will be, part of the intellectual property of man;
great theories have been built upon them, which must be thrown down
before we can raze the foundation. That he repented of having published
the work, and desired to retract its extreme doctrines, is part of the
mental biography of Hume; but it is impossible, at his command, to
detach this book from general literature, or to read it without
remembering who was its author.</p>

<p>But, indeed, there were pretty cogent reasons why the philosophical
world, and Hume's opponents in particular, should not lose sight of his
early work. In the Inquiry, he did not revoke the fundamental doctrines
of his first work. The elements of all thought and knowledge he still
found to be in impressions and ideas. But he did not on this occasion
carry out his principles with the same reckless hardihood that had
distinguished the Treatise; and thus he neither on the one side gave so
distinct and striking a view of his system, nor on the other afforded so
strong a hold to his adversaries. This hold they were resolved not to
lose; and therefore they retained the original bond, and would not
accept of the offered substitute.</p>

<p>Of those views which are more fully developed in the Inquiry than in the
early work, one of the most important is the attempt to establish the
doctrine of <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_275" id="Page_v1_275">[275]</a></span>necessity, and to refute that of free will in relation to
the springs of human action. To those who adopted the vulgar notion of
Hume's theory of cause and effect, that it left the phenomena of nature
without a ruling principle, the attempt to show that the human mind was
bound by necessary laws appeared to be a startling inconsistency&mdash;a sort
of reversal of the poet's idea,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">And binding nature fast in fate,</div>
    <div class="line i1">Left free the human will.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It appeared to remove the chains of necessity from inanimate nature, and
rivet them on the will.</p>

<p>But there is a decided principle of connexion between the two doctrines:
whether or not it be a principle that will bear scrutiny, is another
question. The two systems are identified with each other, simply by the
annihilation of the notion of power both in the material and in the
immaterial world. As we cannot find in physical causes any power to
produce their effect, so when a man moves his arm to strike, or his
tongue to reprimand, we have no notion of any <em>power</em> being exercised;
but we have an impression that certain impulses are followed, and we can
no more suppose that it was at the choice of the individual whether,
when these impulses or motives existed, they should or should not be
obeyed, than that when the phenomenon called in the material world the
cause, made its appearance, there could be any doubt of its being
followed by the effect. The inference from this was, that human actions
are as much the objects of inductive philosophy as the operations of
nature; that they are equally regular, effect following cause as much in
the operations of the passions as in those of the elements. Of the
application of the <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_276" id="Page_v1_276">[276]</a></span>theory to his historical observation of events, the
following passage is a vivid enunciation:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"It is universally acknowledged, that there is a great
uniformity among the actions of men, in all nations and ages,
and that human nature remains still the same in its principles
and operations. The same motives always produce the same
actions; the same events follow from the same causes.
Ambition, avarice, self-love, vanity, friendship, generosity,
public spirit; these passions, mixed in various degrees, and
distributed through society, have been, from the beginning of
the world, and still are, the source of all the actions and
enterprises which have ever been observed among mankind. Would
you know the sentiments, inclinations, and course of life of
the Greeks and Romans? study well the temper and actions of
the French and English: you cannot be much mistaken in
transferring to the former <em>most</em> of the observations which
you have made with regard to the latter. Mankind are so much
the same, in all times and places, that history informs us of
nothing new or strange in this particular. Its chief use is
only to discover the constant and universal principles of
human nature, by showing men in all varieties of circumstances
and situations, and furnishing us with materials from which we
may form our observations, and become acquainted with the
regular springs of human action and behaviour. These records
of wars, intrigues, factions, and revolutions, are so many
collections of experiments, by which the politician or moral
philosopher fixes the principles of his science, in the same
manner as the physician or natural philosopher becomes
acquainted with the nature of plants, minerals, and other
external objects, by the experiments which he forms concerning
them. Nor are the earth, water, <!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_277" id="Page_v1_277">[277]</a></span>and other elements, examined
by Aristotle and Hippocrates, more like to those which at
present lie under our observation, than the men described by
Polybius and Tacitus are to those who now govern the world.</p>

<p>"Should a traveller, returning from a far country, bring us an
account of men wholly different from any with whom we were
ever acquainted, men who were entirely divested of avarice,
ambition, or revenge, who knew no pleasure but friendship,
generosity, and public spirit, we should immediately, from
these circumstances, detect the falsehood, and prove him a
liar, with the same certainty as if he had stuffed his
narration with stories of centaurs and dragons, miracles and
prodigies. And if we would explode any forgery in history, we
cannot make use of a more convincing argument than to prove,
that the actions ascribed to any person are directly contrary
to the course of nature, and that no human motives, in such
circumstances, could ever induce him to such a conduct. The
veracity of Quintus Curtius is as much to be suspected, when
he describes the supernatural courage of Alexander, by which
he was hurried on singly to attack multitudes, as when he
describes his supernatural force and activity, by which he was
able to resist them. So readily and universally do we
acknowledge a uniformity in human motives and actions, as well
as in the operations of body.</p>

<p>"Hence, likewise, the benefit of that experience, acquired by
long life and a variety of business and company, in order to
instruct us in the principles of human nature, and regulate
our future conduct, as well as speculation. By means of this
guide we mount up to the knowledge of men's inclinations and
motives, from their actions, expressions, and even gestures;
and again descend to the interpretation of their <!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_278" id="Page_v1_278">[278]</a></span>actions,
from our knowledge of their motives and inclinations. The
general observations, treasured up by a course of experience,
give us the clue of human nature, and teach us to unravel all
its intricacies. Pretexts and appearances no longer deceive
us. Public declarations pass for the specious colouring of a
cause. And though virtue and honour be allowed their proper
weight and authority, that perfect disinterestedness, so often
pretended to, is never expected in multitudes and parties,
seldom in their leaders, and scarcely even in individuals of
any rank or station. But were there no uniformity in human
actions, and were every experiment, which we could form of
this kind, irregular and anomalous, it were impossible to
collect any general observations concerning mankind; and no
experience, however accurately digested by reflection, would
ever serve to any purpose. Why is the aged husbandman more
skilful in his calling than the young beginner, but because
there is a certain uniformity in the operation of the sun,
rain, and earth, towards the production of vegetables; and
experience teaches the old practitioner the rules by which
this operation is governed and directed?"<a name="FNanchor_278:1_153" id="FNanchor_278:1_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_278:1_153" class="fnanchor">[278:1]</a></p>
</div>


<p>How very clearly we find these principles practically illustrated in his
History! A disinclination to believe in the narratives of great and
remarkable deeds proceeding from peculiar impulses: a propensity, when
the evidence adduced in their favour cannot be rebutted, to treat these
peculiarities rather as diseases of the mind, than as the operation of
noble aspirations: a levelling disposition to find all men pretty much
upon a par, and none in a marked manner better or worse than their
neighbours: an inclination to doubt all <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_279" id="Page_v1_279">[279]</a></span>authorities which tended to
prove that the British people had any fundamental liberties not
possessed by the French and other European nations. Such are the
practical fruits of this necessitarian philosophy.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that Hume promulgated those opinions upon
miracles, which we have found him afraid to make public even in that
work of which he afterwards regretted the bold and rash character. No
part of his writings gave more offence to serious and devout thinkers;
but the offence was in the manner of the promulgation, not the matter of
the opinions. To understand how this occurred, let us cast a glance for
a moment at two opposite classes of religious thinkers, into which a
large portion of the Christian world is divided, and find with which, if
with either, Hume's opinions coincide.</p>

<p>If we suppose a man, impressed with a feeling of devotion and reverence
for a Superior Being, who, seeing in the order of the world and all its
movements, the omnipotent, all-wise, and all-merciful guidance of a
divine Providence, believes that the Great Being will give to his
creatures no revelation that is not in accordance with the merciful
harmony of all his ways; and thus devoutly and submissively receives the
word of God as promulgated in the Bible; attempts to make it the rule of
his actions and opinions; receives with deference the views of those
whom the same power that authorized it, has permitted to be the human
instruments of its promulgation and explanation; tries to understand
what it is within the power of his limited faculties to comprehend; but,
implicitly believing that in the shadows of those mysteries which he is
unable to penetrate, there lie operations as completely part of one
great regular plan, as merciful, as beneficent, and as wise as the
outward and comprehensible acts of <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_280" id="Page_v1_280">[280]</a></span>Providence; who thus never for one
moment allows his mind to doubt, where it is unable to comprehend or
explain&mdash;such a man finds none of his sentiments in the writings of
Hume, for he is at once told there that reason and revelation are two
disconnected things, that each must act alone, and that the one derives
no aid from the other.</p>

<p>But take one who believes that religion is too sacred to be in any way
allied with so poor and miserable a thing as erring human reason; who
feels that it is not in himself to merit any of the boundless mercies of
the atonement; and that to endeavour by his actions, or the direction of
his thoughts, to be made a participator in them, is but setting blind
reason to lead the blind appetites and desires; who feels that by no act
of his own, the true light of the Christian religion has been lighted
within him as by a miracle; who has been adopted by a sudden change in
his spiritual nature into the family of the faithful&mdash;then there is
nothing in all Hume's philosophy to militate against the religion of
such a man, but rather many arguments in its favour, both implied and
expressed.</p>

<p>Since this is the case, it may be asked, why, if one party in religion
attacked the opinions of Hume, another did not defend them? why, if
Beattie and Warburton couched the lance, Whitefield and John Erskine did
not come forward as his champions? In the first place, it was only those
who united reason and revelation as going hand in hand and aiding each
other, that looked at books of philosophy with an eye to their influence
on religion, and such works formed a department of literature in which
the advocates of "eternal decrees" would not expect to find much to suit
their purpose. But, in the second place, this class of religious
thinkers are all, except the few <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_281" id="Page_v1_281">[281]</a></span>who are hypocrites, devout and serious
people, and Hume's method of treating these subjects was not such as
they could feel a sympathy with. A want of proper deference for
devotional feeling, is a defect that runs through all his works&mdash;a
constitutional organic defect it might be termed. There is no ribaldry,
but at the same time there are no expressions of decent reverence; while
this religious party knew from the manner in which their predecessors in
the same doctrines were historically treated by Hume, that if there were
any coincidence in abstract opinions, there was very little in common
between their sympathies and his.</p>

<p>In this same section on miracles, there are repeated protests against
the reader assuming that the writer is arguing against the Christian
faith. Against some Catholic miracles, which were asserted to be proved
by testimony as strong as that which attested the miracles of our
Saviour, he says, "As if the testimony of man could ever be put in the
balance with that of God himself, who conducted the pen of the inspired
writers!" and again, "Our most holy religion is founded on <em>faith</em>, not
on reason; and it is a sure method of exposing it to put it to such a
trial as it is by no means fitted to endure." These protests however
were made briefly and coldly, and in such a manner as made people feel,
that if Hume believed in the doctrines they announced, he certainly had
not his heart in them. Hence, although, since the origin of rationalism,
evangelical Christians have frequently had recourse to the arguments of
Hume, there was long in that quarter a not unnatural reluctance to
appeal to them.</p>

<p>It is perhaps one of the most remarkable warnings against hasty
judgments on the effects of efforts of subtle reasoning, that, according
to later scientific <!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_282" id="Page_v1_282">[282]</a></span>discoveries, no two things are in more perfect
unison than Hume's theory of belief in miracles, and the belief that
miracles, according to the common acceptation of the term, have actually
taken place. The leading principle of this theory is, in conformity with
its author's law of cause and effect, that where our experience has
taught us that two things follow each other as cause and effect by an
unvarying sequence, if we hear of an instance in which this has not been
the case, we ought to doubt the truth of the narrative. In other words,
if we are told of some circumstance having taken place out of the usual
order of nature, we ought not to believe it; because the circumstance of
the narrator having been deceived, or of his designedly telling a
falsehood, is more probable than an event contradictory to all previous
authenticated experience. It is a rule for marking the boundary and
proper application of the inductive system, and one that is highly
serviceable to science. But, in applying it to use, we must not be led
away by the narrow application, in common conversation, of the word
experience. There is the experience of the common workman, and there is
the experience of the philosopher. There is that observation of
phenomena which makes a ditcher know that the difficulty of pulling out
a loosened stone with a mattock indicates it to be so many inches thick;
and that observation, fully as sure, which shows the geologist that the
stratum of the Pennsylvanian grauwacke is upwards of a hundred miles
thick. The experience and observation of the husbandman teach him, that
when the opposite hill is distinct to his view, the intervening
atmosphere is not charged with vapour; but observation, not less
satisfactory, shows the astronomer that Jupiter and the Moon have around
them no atmosphere such as <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_283" id="Page_v1_283">[283]</a></span>that by which our planet is enveloped. Now
there is nothing more fully founded on experimental observation than the
fact, that there was a time when the present order of the world was not
in existence. That there have been convulsions, such as, did we now hear
of their contemporary occurrence, instead of attesting their past
existence through the sure course of observation and induction, we would
at once maintain to be impossible. To this then, and this only, comes
the theory of miracles, that at the present day, and for a great many
years back, the accounts that are given of circumstances having taken
place out of the general order of nature, are to be discredited, because
between the two things to be believed, the falsehood of the narrative is
more likely than the truth of the occurrence. But the very means by
which we arrive at this conclusion bring us to another, that there was a
time to which the rules taken from present observation of the course of
nature did not apply.<a name="FNanchor_283:1_154" id="FNanchor_283:1_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_283:1_154" class="fnanchor">[283:1]</a></p>

<p>That in history, in science, in the conduct of every-day life, and
particularly in the formation of the minds of the young, this rule of
belief is of the highest practical utility, few will doubt. The parish
clergyman, who assists in throwing discredit on all the <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_284" id="Page_v1_284">[284]</a></span>superstitious
stories of spectres, witchcrafts, and demoniacal possessions with which
his neighbourhood may be afflicted, is but an active promulgator of the
doctrine. It was a narrow view that Campbell adopted when he said, that
if we heard of a ferry boat, which had long crossed the stream in
safety, having sunk, we would give credit to the testimony concerning
it.<a name="FNanchor_284:1_155" id="FNanchor_284:1_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_284:1_155" class="fnanchor">[284:1]</a> Our experience teaches us that ferry boats are made of
perishable materials, liable to be submerged; and thus, in this case,
there is no balance of incredibility against the narrator. To have tried
Campbell's practical faith in Hume's theory, he should have had before
him a person professing to have become aware of the sinking of the boat,
by some unprecedented means of perception, called a magnetic influence,
in the absence of a more distinct name; while it is shown that the same
person had an opportunity of being informed, through the organs of
hearing, of the circumstance which had taken place. It would then be
seen, whether that sagacious philosopher would have given the sanction
of his belief to a phenomenon contrary to all previous experience&mdash;the
ascertainment of an external event, without the aid of the senses; or
would have acceded to the too commonly illustrated <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_285" id="Page_v1_285">[285]</a></span>phenomenon, that
human beings are capable of falsehood and folly.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that Hume employed the word miracles in the
title of this inquiry. He thus employed a term which had been applied to
sacred subjects, and raised a natural prejudice against reasonings,
applicable to contemporary events, and to the rules of ordinary
historical belief. He might have found some other title&mdash;such as, "The
Principles of Belief in Human Testimony," which would have more
satisfactorily explained the nature of the inquiry.</p>

<p>But it is not improbable that the odium thus occasioned first introduced
Hume's philosophical works to controversial notoriety. Though
disappointed by the silence of the public immediately on his arrival
from abroad, he has soon to tell us in his "own life,"&mdash;"Meanwhile, my
bookseller, A. Millar, informed me, that my former publications (all but
the unfortunate Treatise) were beginning to be the subject of
conversation; that the sale of them was gradually increasing, and that
new editions were demanded. Answers by reverends and right reverends
came out two and three in a year;<a name="FNanchor_285:1_156" id="FNanchor_285:1_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_285:1_156" class="fnanchor">[285:1]</a> and I found, by Warburton's
railing, that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good
company."<a name="FNanchor_285:2_157" id="FNanchor_285:2_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_285:2_157" class="fnanchor">[285:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_286" id="Page_v1_286">[286]</a></span>It was in the "Inquiry concerning the Human Understanding," that Hume
promulgated the theory of association, which called forth so much
admiration of its simplicity, beauty, and truth. "To me," he says,
"there appear to be only three principles of connexion among ideas,
namely, <em>Resemblance</em>, <em>Contiguity</em> in time or place, and <em>Cause</em> or
<em>Effect</em>.</p>

<p>"That these principles serve to connect ideas, will not, I believe, be
much doubted. A picture naturally leads our thoughts to the original
[Resemblance.] The mention of one apartment in a building, naturally
introduces an inquiry or discourse concerning the others [Contiguity:]
and if we think on a wound, we can scarcely forbear reflecting on the
pain which follows it [Cause and Effect.]"<a name="FNanchor_286:1_158" id="FNanchor_286:1_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_286:1_158" class="fnanchor">[286:1]</a></p>

<p>In connexion with this theory a curious charge has been brought forward
by Coleridge, who says, "In consulting the excellent commentary of St.
Thomas Aquinas, on the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parva Naturalia</span> of Aristotle, I was struck at
once with its close resemblance to Hume's essay on association. The main
thoughts were the same in both. The <em>order</em> of the thoughts was the
same, and even the illustrations differed only by Hume's occasional
substitution of more modern examples. I mentioned the circumstance to
several of my literary acquaintances, who admitted the closeness of the
resemblance, and that it seemed too great to be explained by mere
coincidence; but they thought it improbable that Hume should have held
the pages of the angelic doctor worth turning over. But some time after,
Mr. Payne of the King's Mews, showed Sir James <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_287" id="Page_v1_287">[287]</a></span>Mackintosh some odd
volumes of St. Thomas Aquinas, partly perhaps from having heard that Sir
James, (then Mr. Mackintosh,) had in his lectures passed a high encomium
on this canonized philosopher, but chiefly from the fact that the
volumes had belonged to Mr. Hume, and had here and there marginal marks
and notes of reference in his own handwriting. Among these volumes was
that which contains the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parva Naturalia</span>, in the old Latin version,
swathed and swaddled in the commentary aforementioned."</p>

<p>On this, Sir James Macintosh says, that "the manuscript of a part of
Aquinas, which I bought many years ago, (on the faith of a bookseller's
catalogue,) as being written by Mr. Hume, was not a copy of the
commentary on the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parva Naturalia</cite>, but of Aquinas's own <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Secunda
Secundæ</cite>; and that, on examination, it proves not to be the handwriting
of Mr. Hume, and to contain nothing written by him."<a name="FNanchor_287:1_159" id="FNanchor_287:1_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_287:1_159" class="fnanchor">[287:1]</a> So much for
the external evidence of plagiarism.</p>

<p>With regard to the internal evidence, the passage of Aquinas
particularly referred to, which will be found below,<a name="FNanchor_287:2_160" id="FNanchor_287:2_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_287:2_160" class="fnanchor">[287:2]</a> refers to
memory not imagination; to the recall of images in the relation to each
other in which they have once had a place in the mind, not to <!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_288" id="Page_v1_288">[288]</a></span>the
formation of new associations, or aggregates of ideas there; nor will it
bring the theories to an identity, that, according to Hume's doctrine,
nothing can be recalled in the mind unless its elements have already
been deposited there in the form of ideas, because the observations of
Aquinas apply altogether to the <em>reminiscence</em> of aggregate objects. But
the classification is different: for Hume's embodies cause and effect,
but not contrariety; while that of Aquinas has contrariety, but not
cause and effect. In a division into three elements, this discrepancy is
material; and, without entering on any lengthened reasoning, it may
simply be observed, that the merit of Hume's classification is, that it
is exhaustive, and neither contains any superfluous element, nor omits
any principle under which an act of association can be classed.</p>

<p>But it is remarkable that Coleridge should have failed to keep in view,
in his zeal to discover some curious thing to reward him for his
researches among the fathers, that the classification is not that of
Aquinas, but of Aristotle, and is contained in the very work on which
the passage in Aquinas is one of the many commentaries.<a name="FNanchor_288:1_161" id="FNanchor_288:1_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_288:1_161" class="fnanchor">[288:1]</a></p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p>The "Essays Moral and Political," had, though it is <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_289" id="Page_v1_289">[289]</a></span>not mentioned by
Hume in his "own life," been so well received, that a second edition
appeared in 1742, the same year in which the second volume of the
original edition was published. A third edition was published in London
in 1748,<a name="FNanchor_289:1_162" id="FNanchor_289:1_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_289:1_162" class="fnanchor">[289:1]</a> of which Hume, comparing them with his neglected
contemporaneous publication of the Inquiry, says that they "met not with
a much better reception."</p>

<p>Two essays, which had appeared in the previous editions, were omitted in
the third. One of these, "Of Essay Writing," was evidently written at
the time when the author had the design of publishing his work
periodically,<a name="FNanchor_289:2_163" id="FNanchor_289:2_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_289:2_163" class="fnanchor">[289:2]</a> and was meant as a prospectus or announcement to
the readers, of the method in which he proposed to address them in his
periodical papers. The other was a "Character of Sir Robert Walpole;" a
curious attempt to take an impartial estimate of a man who, at the time
of the first publication, had been longer in office, and was surrounded
by a more numerous and powerful band of enemies, than any previous
British statesman. But between the two publications the enemies had
triumphed; and the statesman of forty years had been driven into
retirement, where death speedily relieved him from a scene of inaction,
which might have been repose to others, but was to him an insupportable
solitude. Party rage had consequently changed its direction, and that
air of solemn deliberation which, while the statesman was moving between
the admiration of his friends and the hatred of his enemies, had an
appearance of resolute stoical impartiality, might have appeared
strained and affected, if the essay had been republished in 1748.</p>

<p>To this third edition three essays were added, "Of <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_290" id="Page_v1_290">[290]</a></span>National
Characters," "Of the Original Contract," and "Of Passive Obedience." The
first of these contains some very curious incidental notices of ancient
morals and habits, so adapted to modern colloquial language and habits,
as to make the descriptions as clear to the unlearned as to the learned;
as, for example, the following notices of the drinking practices of the
ancients:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The ancient Greeks, though born in a warm climate, seem to have been
much addicted to the bottle; nor were their parties of pleasure any
thing but matches of drinking among men, who passed their time
altogether apart from the fair. Yet when Alexander led the Greeks into
Persia, a still more southern climate, they multiplied their debauches
of this kind, in imitation of the Persian manners.<a name="FNanchor_290:1_164" id="FNanchor_290:1_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_290:1_164" class="fnanchor">[290:1]</a> So honourable
was the character of a drunkard among the Persians, that Cyrus the
younger, soliciting the sober Lacedemonians for succour against his
brother Artaxerxes, claims it chiefly on account of his superior
endowments, as more valorous, more bountiful, and a better
drinker.<a name="FNanchor_290:2_165" id="FNanchor_290:2_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_290:2_165" class="fnanchor">[290:2]</a> Darius Hystaspes made it be inscribed on his tomb-stone,
among his other virtues and princely qualities, that no one could bear a
greater quantity of liquor."</p>

<p>The other two essays, though bearing on subjects which have now almost
dropped out of political discussion, "The Original Contract," and
"Passive Obedience," trod close on the heels of the long conflict in
which Milton, Salmasius, Hobbes, Sidney, Locke, and Filmer, had been
partakers; and while the din of arms was far from being exhausted, they
professed to hold the balance equally between the combatants, or, <!-- Page 291 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_291" id="Page_v1_291">[291]</a></span>more
properly speaking, to examine philosophically the merits of the theory
of each party, without taking up the angry arguments of either. They
are, in truth, but a farther adaptation to politics of those utilitarian
theories which Hume had previously applied both to private morals and to
government. And the principle they promulgate is, that the citizen's
allegiance to the laws and constitution of his country, has its proper
foundation neither in an acknowledgment of the divine right of any
governor, nor in a contract with him by which both parties are bound,
but in the moral duty of respecting internal peace and order, and of
avoiding outbreaks which may plunge the people into anarchy and misery,
to gratify the pride or baser passions of turbulent individuals.</p>

<p>It must have been on his return on this occasion, that Hume rejoined the
family circle at Ninewells, bereaved of the parent whose devotion to his
training and education he has so affectionately commemorated. "I went
down," he says, "in 1749, and lived two years with my brother at his
country house, for my mother was now dead."<a name="FNanchor_291:1_166" id="FNanchor_291:1_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_291:1_166" class="fnanchor">[291:1]</a> In a letter, which
will have to be afterwards referred to, by Dr. Black, to Adam Smith,
written when Hume was on his death-bed, and in relation to his final
illness, there is the remark, "His mother," he says, "had precisely the
same constitution with himself, and died of this very disorder."</p>

<p>On this subject, the American traveller, Silliman, gave currency to a
foolish and improbable story, which he puts in the following shape:&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_292" id="Page_v1_292">[292]</a></span>"It seems that Hume received a religious education from his mother, and
early in life was the subject of strong and hopeful religious
impressions; but, as he approached manhood, they were effaced, and
confirmed infidelity succeeded. Maternal partiality, however alarmed at
first, came at length to look with less and less pain upon this
declension, and filial love and reverence seem to have been absorbed in
the pride of philosophical scepticism; for Hume now applied himself with
unwearied, and unhappily with successful efforts, to sap the foundation
of his mother's faith. Having succeeded in this dreadful work, he went
abroad into foreign countries; and as he was returning, an express met
him in London, with a letter from his mother, informing him that she was
in a deep decline, and could not long survive: she said, she found
herself without any support in her distress; that he had taken away that
source of comfort, upon which, in all cases of affliction, she used to
rely, and that now she found her mind sinking into despair. She did not
doubt but her son would afford her some substitute for her religion; and
she conjured him to hasten to her, or at least to send her a letter,
containing such consolations as philosophy can afford to a dying mortal.
Hume was overwhelmed with anguish on receiving this letter, and hastened
to Scotland, travelling day and night; but before he arrived his mother
expired. No permanent impression seems, however, to have been made on
his mind by this most trying event; and whatever remorse he might have
felt at the moment, he soon relapsed into his wonted obduracy of heart."</p>

<p>This story, probably told after dinner, and invented on the spot,&mdash;the
American narrator's unfortunate name perhaps rendering him peculiarly
liable to the <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_293" id="Page_v1_293">[293]</a></span>machinations of the mischievous,&mdash;is totally at variance
with Hume's character. He was no propagandist; and, indeed, seems ever
to have felt, that a firm faith in Christianity, unshaken by any doubts,
was an invaluable privilege, of which it would be as much more cruel to
deprive a fellow-creature than to rob him of his purse, as the one
possession is more valuable than the other. Hence we shall find, that
his conversation was acceptable to women and to clergymen, who never
feared in his presence to encounter any sentiment that might shock their
feelings; and what is more to the point, parents were never afraid of
trusting their children to his care and social attentions, and indeed
thought it a high privilege to obtain them.</p>

<p>The appearance of the above passage in a notice of "Silliman's Travels"
in <cite>The Quarterly Review</cite>, called forth a remonstrance from Baron Hume,
which elicited the following statement from the editor:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_293:1_167" id="FNanchor_293:1_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_293:1_167" class="fnanchor">[293:1]</a></p>

<p>"That anecdote he has shown to be false by unquestionable dates, and by
a circumstance related in the manuscript memoirs of the late Dr.
Carlyle, an eminent clergyman of the Scottish Church, and friend of the
historian. The circumstance, interesting in itself, and decisive on the
subject, we transcribe, in the words of the manuscript, from the letter
before us:&mdash;</p>

<p>"David and he (the Hon. Mr. Boyle, brother of the Earl of Glasgow) were
both in London at the period when David's mother died. Mr. Boyle,
hearing of it, soon after went into his apartment, for they lodged in
the same house, where he found him in the deepest affliction, and in a
flood of tears. After the usual topics of condolence, Mr. Boyle said to
him, 'My friend, you owe this uncommon grief to having <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_294" id="Page_v1_294">[294]</a></span>thrown off the
principles of religion; for if you had not, you would have been consoled
with the firm belief that the good lady, who was not only the best of
mothers but the most pious of Christians, was completely happy in the
realms of the just.' To which David replied, 'Though I throw out my
speculations to entertain the learned and metaphysical world, yet, in
other things, I do not think so differently from the rest of the world
as you imagine.'"<a name="FNanchor_294:1_168" id="FNanchor_294:1_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_294:1_168" class="fnanchor">[294:1]</a></p>

<p>One of Hume's most intimate friends was Dr. Clephane, a physician in
considerable practice in London. They appear to have become acquainted
with each <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_295" id="Page_v1_295">[295]</a></span>other during the expedition to Port L'Orient, in which
Clephane was probably a medical officer, as Hume, in his letters about
his own half-pay, speaks of him as in the same position with himself.
The correspondence is characterized by the thorough ease and polite
familiarity of the camp, and none of Hume's letters <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_296" id="Page_v1_296">[296]</a></span>are fuller of his
playful spirit than those addressed to his brother officer.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I have here received a great many thanks from
an honest man, who tells me that he and all his family have
been extremely obliged to me. This is my brother's gardener,
who showed me a letter from his son, wherein he acknowledges
that he owes his life to your care; that you placed him in an
hospital, and attended him with as much assiduity as if he had
been the best nobleman in the land; that all he shall ever be
worth will never be able to repay you: and that therefore he
must content himself with being grateful: at the same time
desiring his father to give me thanks, by whose means he was
recommended to you.</p>

<p>"These thanks I received with great gravity, and <!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_297" id="Page_v1_297">[297]</a></span>replied,
that one must always endeavour to do good when it is in one's
power. In short, I took upon me your part, and gave myself as
many airs as if I had really shown the same beneficent
dispositions. I considered that you have good deeds to spare,
and are possessed of greater store of merits and works of
supererogation, than any church, Pagan, Mahometan, or
Catholic, ever was entitled to, and that, therefore, to rob
you a little was no great crime:&mdash;</p>

may take your own reward yourself for me. I shall never
trouble my head about the matter, and you need not expect that
I shall even like or esteem you the better for this instance
of your charity and humanity. You fancy, I suppose, that I
already liked and esteemed you so much, that this makes no
sensible addition. You may fancy what you please: I shall not
so much as speak another word upon this subject, but proceed
to a better. You shall see.</p>

<p>"You would perhaps ask, how I employ my time in this leisure
and solitude, and what are my occupations? Pray, do you expect
I should convey to you an encyclopedia, in the compass of a
letter? The last thing I took my hand from was a very learned,
elaborate discourse, concerning the populousness of antiquity;
not altogether in opposition to <em>Vossius</em> and <em>Montesquieu</em>,
who exaggerate that affair infinitely; <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_298" id="Page_v1_298">[298]</a></span>but, starting some
doubts, and scruples, and difficulties, sufficient to make us
suspend our judgment on that head. Amongst other topics, it
fell in my way to consider the greatness of ancient <em>Rome</em>;
and in looking over the discourse, I find the following
period. 'If we may judge by the younger Pliny's account of his
house, and by the plans of ancient buildings in Dr. Mead's
collection, the men of quality had very spacious palaces, and
their buildings were like the Chinese houses, where each

advertised pills for an earthquake, at a time when people lay
under such terrors as they do at present. But I know not if
any of the faculty have imitated him at this time. I see only
a Pastoral Letter of the Bishop of London, where, indeed, he
recommends certain pills, such as fasting, prayer, repentance,
mortification, and other drugs, which are entirely to come
from his own shop. And I think this is very unfair in him, and
you have great reason to be offended; for why might he not
have added, that medicinal powders and potions would also have
done service? The worst is, that you dare not revenge yourself
in kind, by advising your patients to have nothing to do with
the parson; for you are sure he has a faster hold of them than
you, and you may yourself be discharged on such an
advice.<a name="FNanchor_299:1_173" id="FNanchor_299:1_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_299:1_173" class="fnanchor">[299:1]</a></p>

<p>The following letter to Oswald shows us that Hume was, at the time it
was written, earnestly engaged in the preparation of the "Essays on
Political Economy," which he published in 1752.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">James Oswald</span> <i>of Dunnikier</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I confess I was a little displeased with you for
neglecting me so long; but you have made ample compensation.
This commerce, I find, is of advantage to both of us; to me,
by the new lights you communicate, and to you, by giving you
occasion to examine these subjects more accurately. I shall
here deliver my opinion of your reasonings with the freedom
which you desire.</p>

<p>"I never meant to say that money, in all countries which
communicate, must necessarily be on a level, but on a level
proportioned to their people, industry, and commodities. That
is, where there is double people, &amp;c. there will be double
money, and so on; and that the only way of keeping or
increasing money is, by keeping and increasing the people and
industry; not by prohibitions of exporting money, or by taxes
on commodities, the methods commonly thought of. <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_302" id="Page_v1_302">[302]</a></span>I believe we
differ little on this head. You allow, that if all the money
in England were increased fourfold in one night, there would
be a sudden rise of prices; but then, say you, the importation
of foreign commodities would soon lower the prices. Here,
then, is the flowing out of the money already begun. But, say
you, a small part of this stock of money would suffice to buy
foreign commodities, and lower the prices. I grant it would
for one year, till the imported commodities be consumed. But
must not the same thing be renewed next year? No, say you; the
additional stock of money may, in this interval, so increase
the people and industry, as to enable them to retain their
money. Here I am extremely pleased with your reasoning. I
agree with you, that the increase of money, if not too sudden,
naturally increases people and industry, and by that means may
retain itself; but if it do not produce such an increase,
nothing will retain it except hoarding. Suppose twenty
millions brought into Scotland; suppose that, by some
fatality, we take no advantage of this to augment our industry
or people, how much would remain in the quarter of a century?
not a shilling more than we have at present. My expression in
the Essay needs correction, which has occasioned you to
mistake it.</p>

<p>"Your enumeration of the advantages of rich countries above
poor, in point of trade, is very just and curious; but I
cannot agree with you that, barring ill policy or accidents,
the former might proceed gaining upon the latter for ever. The
growth of every thing, both in art and nature, at last checks
itself. The rich country would acquire and retain all the
manufactures that require great stock or great skill; but the
poor country would gain from it all the <!-- Page 303 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_303" id="Page_v1_303">[303]</a></span>simpler and more
laborious. The manufactures of London, you know, are steel,
lace, silk, books, coaches, watches, furniture, fashions; but
the outlying provinces have the linen and woollen trade.</p>

<p>"The distance of China is a physical impediment to the
communication, by reducing our commerce to a few commodities;
and by heightening the price of these commodities, on account
of the long voyage, the monopolies, and the taxes. A Chinese
works for three-halfpence a-day, and is very industrious; were
he as near us as France or Spain, every thing we used would be
Chinese, till money and prices came to a level; that is, to
such a level as is proportioned to the numbers of people,
industry, and commodities of both countries.</p>

<p>"A part of our public funds serve in place of money; for our
merchants, but still more our bankers, keep less cash by them
when they have stock, because they can dispose of that upon
any sudden demand. This is not the case with the French funds.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rentes</i> of the Hotel de Ville are not transferable, but
are most of them entailed in the families. At least, I know
there is a great difference in this respect betwixt them and
the <em>actions</em> of the Indian Company.</p>

<p>"That the industry and people of Spain, after the discovery of
the West Indies, at first increased more than is commonly
imagined, is a very curious fact; and I doubt not but you say
so upon good authority, though I have not met with that
observation in any author.</p>

<p>"Beside the bad effects of the paper credit in our colonies,
as it was a cheat, it must also be allowed that it banished
gold and silver, by supplying their place. On the whole, my
intention in the Essay was to remove people's terrors, who are
apt, from chimerical <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_304" id="Page_v1_304">[304]</a></span>calculations, to imagine they are losing
their specie, though they can show in no instance that either
their people or industry diminish; and also to expose the
absurdity of guarding money otherwise than by watching over
the people and their industry, and preserving or increasing
them. To prohibit the exportation of money, or the importation
of commodities, is mistaken policy; and I have the pleasure of
seeing you agree with me.</p>

<p>"I have no more to say, but compliments; and therefore shall
conclude. I am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_304:1_179" id="FNanchor_304:1_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_304:1_179" class="fnanchor">[304:1]</a></p>

<p class="datelineit">"Ninewells, 1st November, 1750."</p>
</div>


<p>In 1750 there was published in Edinburgh, an edition of Montesquieu's
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit des Loix; avec les dernieres corrections et illustrations de
l'Auteur</span>."<a name="FNanchor_304:2_180" id="FNanchor_304:2_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_304:2_180" class="fnanchor">[304:2]</a> That Hume was instrumental to this publication, is
shown by the letters addressed to him by Montesquieu between the years
1749 and 1753, printed in the <a href="#APPENDIX_B">appendix</a>. It appears, that, as he there
intimates, the author sent over a copy of his corrections and
illustrations; but the work must have been partly printed before their
arrival, for, in the advertisement to the reader, it is stated that a
few of the earliest sheets, where the more important amendments
occurred, had to be <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_305" id="Page_v1_305">[305]</a></span>reprinted, while some minor alterations are
supplied by a list of corrections.</p>

<p>Montesquieu's appreciation of some of Hume's ethical works will be read
with interest. Hume appears to have made the first advances towards an
intimacy; and the great Frenchman, then in his sixtieth year, seems to
have hailed with satisfaction the appearance of a kindred spirit, and to
have received his proffers with warm cordiality. This is the
commencement of that intercourse with his eminent contemporaries in
France, which we shall hereafter find to occupy a prominent feature in
Hume's literary and social history.</p>

<p>At this period we find Hume taking much interest in the conduct of a
certain James Fraser, in connexion with the Westminster election of
1749&mdash;one of the marked epochs in the parliamentary history of that
renowned constituency. The candidates were Lord Trentham the eldest son
of Earl Gower, and Sir George Vandeput, of whom the former was returned
by the high bailiff. Sir George Vandeput was the "independent"
candidate, representing the "English interest." Lord Trentham was a
placeman, and was accused of a partiality for French interests. Though
the Jacobites were ranged on the Vandeput side, Lord Trentham was by
implication accused of having favoured the exiled family; as by one of
the election placards issued on the occasion, the voters are desired to
"ask Lord Trentham, who had his foot in the stirrup in the year 1715?"
He was charged with having sacrificed his country or Jacobite principles
for a place, and with being that most abhorred of all political
characters, an ex-patriot, who has ratted to obtain office. Shortly
before the election, a riotous attack had been made on a small French
theatre, which had <!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_306" id="Page_v1_306">[306]</a></span>become peculiarly unpopular by obtaining a licence,
when some English establishments had been suppressed under Walpole's
act. It appears that Lord Trentham had, with some others, endeavoured to
preserve the friendless foreigners from the fury of the mob. So
un-English an act, as this harbouring and protecting of foreign
vagabonds, against the just indignation of true born Britons, was very
successfully displayed as an overt act in favour of Popery, Jacobitism,
and French ascendency; and the skilful manner in which it was improved,
in the hand-bills, and pasquinades of the Vandeput party, shows that
this department of the electioneering art was not then far from its
present state of maturity.<a name="FNanchor_306:1_181" id="FNanchor_306:1_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:1_181" class="fnanchor">[306:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_307" id="Page_v1_307">[307]</a></span>A pretty minute investigation has not enabled me to discover what
precise conduct in connexion with this affair was important enough to
elicit from Hume the elaborate joke against Fraser embodied in the
following papers. He was evidently a medical man, but he does not appear
in the list of those who attested Mr. Murray's health, or were appointed
to visit him. He certainly acted on the Vandeput side, yet his name is
nowhere mentioned, in connexion with it, in a pretty large collection of
documents relating to this election, which I have had an opportunity of
consulting.<a name="FNanchor_307:1_182" id="FNanchor_307:1_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_307:1_182" class="fnanchor">[307:1]</a></p>

<p>Fraser was evidently, like Clephane, one of the medical officers in
General St. Clair's expedition, for, in a previous letter to Colonel
Abercromby, Hume mentions him as an officer in the royal
regiment.<a name="FNanchor_307:2_183" id="FNanchor_307:2_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_307:2_183" class="fnanchor">[307:2]</a> He appears to have been a thorough Jacobite, for, in
another <!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_308" id="Page_v1_308">[308]</a></span>letter, Hume speaks of him as one of the extreme persons whom
his history will displease by its too great partiality to the Whigs. A
very pleasing and natural description of his character is given by Hume,
in a letter to Clephane, a little farther on.<a name="FNanchor_308:1_184" id="FNanchor_308:1_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_308:1_184" class="fnanchor">[308:1]</a></p>

<p>The following document was sent to Colonel Abercromby, along with the
explanatory letters which immediately follow it.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="bqhead">To the Right Honourable the Lord Chief Justice Reason, and the
Honourable the Judges Discretion, Prudence, Reserve, and
Deliberation, the Petition of the Patients of Westminster,
against James Fraser, Apothecary.</p>

<p>Most humbly showeth,</p>

<p>That your petitioners had put themselves and families under the
direction and care of the said James Fraser, and had so continued for
several years, to their great mutual benefit and emolument.</p>

<p>That many of your petitioners had, under his management, recovered from
the most desperate and deplorable maladies, such as megrims, toothaches,
cramps, stitches, vapours, crosses in love, &amp;c. which wonderful success,
after the blessing of God, they can ascribe to nothing but his
consummate skill and capacity, since many of their neighbours, labouring
<!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_309" id="Page_v1_309">[309]</a></span>under the same distresses, died every day, by the mistakes of less
learned apothecaries.</p>

<p>That there are many disconsolate widows among your petitioners, who
believed themselves, and were believed by all their neighbours, to be
dying of grief; but as soon as the said James Fraser applied lenitives,
and proper topical medicines, they were observed to recover wonderfully.</p>

<p>That in all hypochondriacal cases he was sovereign, in so much that his
very presence dispelled the malady, cheering the sight, exciting a
gentle agitation of the muscles of the lungs and thorax, and thereby
promoting expectoration, exhilaration, circulation, and digestion.</p>

<p>That your petitioners verily believe, that not many more have died from
amongst them, under the administration of the said James Fraser, than
actually die by the course of nature in places where physic is not at
all known or practised; which will scarcely be credited in this
sceptical and unbelieving age.</p>

<p>That all this harmony and good agreement betwixt your petitioners and
the said James Fraser had lately been disturbed, to the great detriment
of your petitioners and their once numerous families.</p>

<p>That the said James Fraser, associating himself with &mdash;&mdash; Carey,
surgeon, and William Guthrey, Esq. and other evil intentioned persons,
not having the fear of God before their eyes, had given himself entirely
up to the care of Dame <strong>Public</strong>, and had utterly neglected your
petitioners.</p>

<p>That the lady above mentioned was of a most admirable <strong class="allcap">CONSTITUTION</strong>,
envied by all who had ever seen her or heard of her; and was only
afflicted sometimes with vapours, and sometimes with a looseness <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_310" id="Page_v1_310">[310]</a></span>or
flux, which not being of the bloody kind, those about her were rather
pleased with it.</p>

<p>That notwithstanding this, the said James Fraser uses all diligence and
art to persuade the said lady that she is in the most desperate case
imaginable, and that nothing will recover her but a medicine he has
prepared, being a composition of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulvis pyrius</i>,<a name="FNanchor_310:1_185" id="FNanchor_310:1_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:1_185" class="fnanchor">[310:1]</a> along with a
decoction of northern steel, and an infusion of southern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aqua sacra</i> or
holy water.</p>

<p>That the medicine, or rather poison, was at first wrapt up under a wafer
marked Patriotism, but had since been attempted to be administrated
without any cover or disguise.</p>

<p>That a dose of it had secretly been poured down the throat of the said
Dame Public, while she was asleep, and had been attended with the most
dismal symptoms, visibly heightening her vapours, and increasing her
flux, and even producing some symptoms of the bloody kind; and had she
not thrown it up with great violence, it had certainly proved fatal to
her.</p>

<p>That the said James Fraser and his associates, now finding that the
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catholicon</cite> does not agree with the constitution of the said Dame,
prescribed to her large doses of <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phillipiacum</cite>, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cottontium</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_310:2_186" id="FNanchor_310:2_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:2_186" class="fnanchor">[310:2]</a>
and <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vandeputiana</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_310:3_187" id="FNanchor_310:3_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:3_187" class="fnanchor">[310:3]</a> in order to alter her constitution, and
prepare her body for the reception of the said <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catholicon</span>.</p>

<p>That he had even been pleased to see <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lovitium</span><a name="FNanchor_310:4_188" id="FNanchor_310:4_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:4_188" class="fnanchor">[310:4]</a> applied to her,
though known to be a virulent caustic, and really no better than a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapis infernalis</i>.</p>

<p>That while the medicines Goveriacum and <!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_311" id="Page_v1_311">[311]</a></span>Trentuntium<a name="FNanchor_311:1_189" id="FNanchor_311:1_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_311:1_189" class="fnanchor">[311:1]</a> were very
violent, resembling sublimate of <em>high flown</em> mercury, he also much
approved of them, but since they were mollified by late operations, and
made as innocent as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mercurius dulcis</span>, they were become his utter
aversion.</p>

<p>That the said James Fraser, through his whole practice on the said Dame
Public, entirely rejected all lenitives, soporifics, palliatives, &amp;c.
though approved of by the regular and graduate physicians, as Dr.
Pelham, Dr. Fox, Dr. Pitt; and that he prescribed nothing but chemical
salts and stimulating medicines, in which regimen none but quacks and
empirics who had never taken their degrees will agree with him.</p>

<p>That your petitioners remember the story of an Irish servant to a
physician, which seems fitted to the present purpose. The doctor bid
Teague carry a potion to a patient, and tell him it was the most
innocent in the world, and if it did him no good, could do him no harm.
The footman obeys, but unluckily transposing a word, said, that if it
did him no harm it could do him no good. And your petitioners are much
afraid that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">catholicon</span> above mentioned is much of the same nature.</p>

<p class="bqsign">May it therefore please your worships to discharge the said
James Fraser from any farther attendance on the said Dame
Public, and to order him to return to the care and inspection
of your petitioners and their families.</p>

<p>The following is the letter which, in pursuance of the arrangements for
completing this complicated joke, Colonel Abercromby was to read to
Fraser. Its tone of mock heroic will at once be detected, and indeed,
when the spilling of the last drop of blood, "or of ink," is with so
much simplicity made an alternative, it may be presumed that James
Fraser <!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_313" id="Page_v1_313">[313]</a></span>was a very obtuse being, if he believed these protestations to
be serious.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;This will be delivered you by Mr. William
Cockburn, a friend of mine, who travels to London for the
first time. I have taken the opportunity to send up by him a
manuscript, which I intend to have printed. I have ordered him
first to read it to you; but not to trust it out of his hands.
You can scarce be surprised that I treat Mr. Fraser so roughly
in it. No man, who loves his country, can be a friend to that
gentleman, considering his late as well as former behaviour.
For if I be rightly informed, his conduct shows no more the
spirit of submission and tranquillity than that of prudence
and discretion; and if he goes on at this rate, you yourself
will be obliged to renounce all connexion and friendship with
him.</p>

<p>"I have been ill of late; and am very low at present from the
loss of blood which they have drawn from me. My friends would
hinder me from reading; but my books and my pen are my only
comfort and occupation; and while I am master of a drop of

country. <span style="padding-left: 5em;">I am, Dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>In the following letter to Dr. Clephane, we find that the practical joke
on James Fraser, which seems to have given a good deal of employment to
the wits of a great philosopher, a learned physician, and a gallant
colonel, is still a matter which Hume has very much at heart; while at
the same time he seems to have been amusing himself with some other
jocular <!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_314" id="Page_v1_314">[314]</a></span>effusions. The letter presents us with his first commemoration
of the poetical genius of his friend, John Home, though it gives no
forecast of the zeal with which he subsequently advocated his
countryman's claims to originality and high genius. The dramatic critic
will probably feel an interest in the light thrown on Hume's
appreciation of Shakspere by the manner in which his name is connected
with that of Racine.</p>

<p><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ed io anche sóno Pittore</span>, as Correggio said; I am therefore
resolved to forgive you, and to keep myself in a proper
disposition for saying the Lord's prayer, whenever I shall
find space enough for it.</p>

<p>"I must own I could not but think you excusable, even before
you disarmed me by your submission and penitence; 'tis so
common an artifice for provincials to hook on a correspondence
with a Londoner, under pretext of friendship and regard, that
a jealousy on that head is very pardonable in the latter. But
I ought not to lie under that general suspicion; for the
fashionable songs I cannot sing; the present or the expectant
ministers I have no interest in; the old good books I have not
yet all read or pondered sufficiently; and the current stories
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mots</i>, I would <!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_315" id="Page_v1_315">[315]</a></span>not repeat if I knew them. You see,
therefore, that if I were not concerned about Dr. Clephane, I
never should desire to hear from him, and consequently that a
line of his would be equally acceptable whether it comes from
London or Crookhaven.</p>

<p>"I have executed your desire and the Colonel's as well as I
could, but have not, I believe, succeeded so well as last
year: the subject, indeed, was exhausted, and the patient may
justly, I fear, be esteemed incurable. I leave you to manage
the matter as you best can: but I beg of you to conduct it, so
as not to make a quarrel betwixt Fraser and me; he is an
honest, good-humoured, friendly, pleasant fellow, (though, it
must be confessed, a little turbulent and impetuous,) and I
should be sorry to disoblige him. The Colonel would be
heartily bit, if by this or any other means Fraser should be
cured of his politics and patriotism; all his friends would
lose a great deal of diversion, and certainly would not like
him near so well, if he were more cool and reasonable, and
moderate, and prudent. But these are vices he is in no manner
of danger of. Is it likely that reason will prevail against
nature, habit, company, education, and prejudice? I leave you
to judge.</p>

<p>"But since I am in the humour of displaying my wit, I must
tell you that lately, at an idle hour, I wrote a sheet called
the Bellman's Petition: wherein (if I be not partial, which I
certainly am,) there was some good pleasantry and satire. The
Printers in Edinburgh refused to print it, (a good sign,
you'll say, of <em>my</em> prudence and discretion.) Mr. Mure, the
member, has a copy of it; ask it of him if you meet with him,
or bid the Colonel, who sees him every day at the house, ask
it, and if you like it read it to the General, and then return
it. I will not boast, for I have no <!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_316" id="Page_v1_316">[316]</a></span>manner of vanity; but
when I think of the present dulness of London, I cannot
forbear exclaiming,</p>

<p>A namesake of mine has wrote a Tragedy, which he expects to
come on this winter.<a name="FNanchor_316:1_190" id="FNanchor_316:1_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_316:1_190" class="fnanchor">[316:1]</a> I have not seen it, but some
people commend it much. 'Tis very likely to meet with success,
and not to deserve it, for the author tells me, he is a great
admirer of Shakspere, and never read Racine.</p>

<p>"When I take a second perusal of your letter, I find you
resemble the Papists, who deal much in penitence, but neglect
extremely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les bonnes œuvres</i>. I asked you a question with
regard to the plans of ancient buildings in Dr. Mead's
collection.<a name="FNanchor_316:2_191" id="FNanchor_316:2_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_316:2_191" class="fnanchor">[316:2]</a> Pray, are they authentic enough to be cited
in a discourse of erudition and reasoning? have they never
been published in any collection? and what are the proper
terms in which I ought to cite them? I know you are a great
proficient in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">virtu</i>, and consequently can resolve my
doubts. This word I suppose you pretend to speak with an (e),
which I own is an improvement: but admitting your orthography,
you must naturally have a desire of doing a good-natured
action, and instructing the ignorant.</p>

<p>"It appears to me that apothecaries bear the same relation to
physicians, that priests do to philosophers; the ignorance of
the former makes them positive, and dogmatical, and assuming,
and enterprising, and pretending, and consequently much more
taking with the people. Follow my example&mdash;let us not trouble
ourselves about the matter; let the one stuff the beasts'

no more, but as <ins class="greek" title="es tên amida enourountes" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ες την αμιδα ενουρουντες</ins>.</p>

<p>"You may tell me, indeed, that I mistake the matter quite;
that it is not your kindness for the people, which makes you
concerned, but something else. In short, that if self-interest
were not in the case, they might take clysters, and physic,
and ipecacuanha, till they were tired of them. Now, dear
Doctor, this mercenary way of thinking I never could have
suspected you of, and am heartily ashamed to find you of such
a temper.</p>

<p>"If you answer this any time within the twelve months 'tis
sufficient, and I promise not to answer you next at less than
six months' interval; and so, as the Germans say, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je me

<p>The "Bellman's Petition," more than once alluded to in Hume's letters,
is a little jeu d'esprit, to which he seems to have attributed far more
than its due importance. The clergy and schoolmasters of Scotland were
then appealing to the legislature for an increase of their incomes; and
in this production, Hume, in a sort of parody on the representation of
these reverend and learned bodies, shows that bell-ringers have the
same, or even greater claims on the liberality of the public. It is
perhaps a little too like the original, of which it professes to be a
parody; and though it has some wit, is deficient in the bitter ridicule,
which Swift would have thrown into such an effort. The following are
some passages:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That as your petitioners serve in the quality of grave-diggers, the
great use and necessity of their order, in every well regulated
commonwealth, has <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_318" id="Page_v1_318">[318]</a></span>never yet been called in question by any reasoner; an
advantage they possess above their brethren the reverend clergy.</p>

<p>"That their usefulness is as extensive as it is great, for even those
who neglect religion or despise learning, must yet, some time or other,
stand in need of the good offices of this grave and venerable order.</p>

<p>"That it seems impossible the landed gentry can oppose the interest of
your petitioners; since, by securing so perfectly as they have hitherto
done, the persons of the fathers and elder brothers of the foresaid
gentry, your petitioners, next after the physicians, are the persons in
the world, to whom the present proprietors of land are the most
beholden.</p>

<p>"That, as your petitioners are but half ecclesiastics, it may be
expected they will not be altogether unreasonable nor exorbitant in
their demands.</p>

<p>"That the present poverty of your petitioners in this kingdom is a
scandal to all religion; it being easy to prove, that a modern bellman
is not more richly endowed than a primitive apostle, and consequently
possesseth not the twentieth part of the revenues belonging to a
presbyterian clergyman.</p>

<p>"That whatever freedom the profane scoffers, and free thinkers of the
age, may use with our reverend brethren the clergy, the boldest of them
tremble when they think of us; and that a simple reflection on us has
reformed more lives than all the sermons in the world.</p>

<p>"That the instrumental music allotted to your petitioners, being the
only music of that kind left in our truly reformed churches, is a
necessary prelude to the vocal music of the schoolmaster and minister,
and is by many esteemed equally significant and melodious.</p>

<p><!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_319" id="Page_v1_319">[319]</a></span>"That your petitioners trust the honourable house will not despise them
on account of the present meanness of their condition; for, having heard
a learned man say that the cardinals, who are now princes, were once
nothing but the parish curates of Rome, your petitioners, observing the
same laudable measures to be now prosecuted, despair not of being, one
day, on a level with the nobility and gentry of these realms."</p>

<p>The petition of which this is a specimen, is accompanied by a letter,
signed "Zerubabel Macgilchrist, Bellman of Buckhaven;" who kindly says
to the members of parliament he addresses, that the brother to whom is
allotted "the comfortable task of doing you the last service in our
power, shall do it so carefully, that you never shall find reason to
complain of him."<a name="FNanchor_319:1_192" id="FNanchor_319:1_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_319:1_192" class="fnanchor">[319:1]</a></p>

to be confirmed by the absence of this Edition in places where such

under his own view. In the "Dialogues concerning Natural Religion" he
makes Philo say, "Strong and almost incontestable proofs may be traced
over the whole earth, that every part of this globe has continued for
many ages entirely covered with water. And though order were supposed
inseparable from matter, and inherent in it, yet may matter be
susceptible of many and great revolutions through the endless periods of
eternal duration." That even Hume's argument makes allowance for
miracles having some time or other existed, and that it can only be
urged against this or that individual statement of an unnatural
occurrence, is the weapon which Campbell wields with chief effect in his
admirable dissertation.</p>

consists with my knowledge that the passage boat has a thousand times
crossed the river, and as many times returned safe. An unknown man, whom
I have just now met, tells me in a serious manner that it is lost; and
affirms, that he himself, standing on the bank, was a spectator of the
scene; that he saw the passengers carried down the stream and the boat
overwhelmed. No person, who is influenced in his judgment of things, not
by philosophical subtleties, but by common sense, a much surer guide,
will hesitate to declare, that in such a testimony I have probable
evidence of the fact asserted."&mdash;Dissertation on Miracles, 46-47.</p>

strongly tempted to have a stroke at Hume in passing. He is the author
of a little book called 'Philosophical Essays;' in one part of which he
argues against the being of a God, and in another (very needlessly you
will say,) against the possibility of miracles. He has crowned the
liberty of the press: and yet he has a considerable post under the
government. I have a great mind to do justice on his arguments against
miracles, which I think might be done in a few words. But does he
deserve notice? Is he known among you? Pray answer these questions. For
if his own weight keeps him down, I should be sorry to contribute to his
advancement to any place but the pillory." Letters from a late Rev.

Mrs. Hume, expressing her opinion of her son David and his
accomplishments, said, "Our Davie's a fine good-natured crater, but
uncommon wake-minded." I have heard this adduced as a proof of the
philosopher's gentle, passive nature, and the effect it had in stamping
an impression of his character on one not capable of appreciating his
genius. But the anecdote is not characteristic of either party, and
arises out of the common mistake that Hume was all his life tame,
phlegmatic, and unimpassioned. However much he had tutored himself to
stoicism, and had succeeded in conquering the outward demonstrations of
strong feelings, it will be seen in various documents quoted in these
volumes, and in the incidents narrated, that he was a man of strong
impulses, full of blood and nerve, and that, as in a high-mettled horse,
his energies were regulated, not extinguished. No one who had the
training of his youth could have escaped observing in him the workings
of strong aspirations, and of a hardy resolute temper.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hume was evidently an accomplished woman, worthy of the
sympathy and respect of her distinguished son, and could not have failed
to see and to appreciate from its earliest dawnings the originality and
power of his intellect. Her portrait, which I have seen, represents a
thin but pleasing countenance, expressive of great intellectual
acuteness. Some verses, which a lady, who is her direct descendant,
authenticates as being in her handwriting, are in the curious collection
of autographs and illustrated portraits, in the possession of Mr. W. F.
Watson, Prince's Street, Edinburgh. It has been supposed that they are
the composition of David Hume himself; but the use of the Scottish
language almost amounts to evidence against that supposition: he would
as readily have walked the streets of Edinburgh in a kilt. The lines are
called "Song.&mdash;Air, Mary's Dream," and begin&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps this may be as good an opportunity as any other for the
insertion of some lines, carefully preserved in the MSS. R.S.E., which
are at least so far to the present purpose, that they give a pleasing
idea of the social circle at Ninewells. They are addressed to a lady who
had lived to see her grandchildren; which does not appear to have been
the case with the mother of the historian, as her eldest son was not
married till 1751. A dowager of an elder generation may have lived for
some time at Ninewells during David Hume's youth, though he does not
mention her: or there may have been some collateral member of the
family, to whom the lines may have been addressed; for, in a series of
extracts which I have obtained from the Kirk Session Records of
Chirnside, I find that a David Home <em>in</em> Ninewells, who cannot have been
a lineal ancestor of the philosopher, had a numerous family baptized
between 1691 and 1701. The lines are entitled "Miss A. B. to Mrs. H. by
her Black Boy;" and however the genealogical questions, we have just
been considering, may stand, their intrinsic merit, as embodying a
beautiful and humane sentiment, entitle them to notice.&mdash;Query, is it to
this alone, or to some extrinsic interest attached to Miss A. B. that we
are to attribute the careful preservation of the lines by Hume?</p>

would have been noticed. I had been awake, and had scarce dosed again.
On a sudden I felt my bolster lift up my head: I thought somebody was
getting from under my bed, but soon found it was a strong earthquake,
that lasted near half a minute, with a violent vibration and great
roaring. I rang my bell; my servant came in, frightened out of his
senses. In an instant we heard all the windows in the neighbourhood
flung up. I got up, and found people running into the streets; but saw
no mischief done. There has been some: two old houses flung down,
several chimneys, and much china ware."&mdash;Letters to Sir H. Man, ii. 349.</p>

<p>"Dick Leveson and Mr. Rigby, who had supped and staid late at Bedford
House, the other night, knocked at several doors, and in a watchman's
voice cried, 'Past four o'clock, and a dreadful earthquake.'"&mdash;Ib. 354.</p>

<p>This election gave birth to some incidents apparently trifling, which
yet make a material figure in British history, from their connexion with
the vindication of the privileges of the House of Commons. The
Honourable Alexander Murray, brother of Lord Elibank, a gentleman who
will probably be again called up in a future part of these pages, was
charged along with Mr. Crowle, an attorney, and another person, with the
use of "threatening and affronting expressions," by the high bailiff.
They were brought before the bar of the House, and after some discussion
and inquiry, Crowle confessed, was submissive, received the usual
reprimand on his knees, and wiped them when he rose, saying, it was "the
dirtiest house he had ever been in." Murray denied the charge, and
resisted the House, "smiled," as Walpole says, "when he was taxed with
having called Lord Trentham and the high bailiff, rascals," and,
finally, refused to kneel, saying, "Sir, I beg to be excused, I never
kneel but to God." Then followed imprisonment, and embarrassing
questions about the prisoner's health, which, sinking under his
self-inflicted imprisonment, reproached those who could not turn back on
the course they had taken; the whole being rendered more complex by the
difficulty of finding a guiding rule in the precedents of the House,
until parliament was adjourned; and he left Newgate in a triumphant
procession, proclaiming the device of "Murray and Liberty."</p>

Mr. afterwards Sir Gilbert Elliot of Minto. A small portion of the
letters, of which their correspondence consists, has already been
embodied in philosophical literature;<a name="FNanchor_320:1_193" id="FNanchor_320:1_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:1_193" class="fnanchor">[320:1]</a> and I have now, through the
favour of the noble descendant of the person to whom they were
addressed, an opportunity of presenting the reader with all those
portions of Hume's letters to Sir Gilbert Elliot, now existing, which
have any claim on public attention, whether as containing valuable
philosophical speculations, or throwing light on the social habits and
intercourse of the two distinguished correspondents.<a name="FNanchor_320:2_194" id="FNanchor_320:2_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:2_194" class="fnanchor">[320:2]</a></p>

<p>Sir Gilbert Elliot was the third baronet of the family of Minto, who
bore the same Christian name.<a name="FNanchor_320:3_195" id="FNanchor_320:3_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:3_195" class="fnanchor">[320:3]</a> <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_321" id="Page_v1_321">[321]</a></span>He joined the Scottish bar,

literature he is known as the author of some pretty pieces of poetry,
among which, the popular song of "My Sheep I neglected," is well
esteemed by the admirers of pastoral lyrics. His acquirements as a
scholar and philosopher are amply attested by his correspondence with
Hume.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Ninewells, near Berwick, 10th February, 1751.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;About six weeks ago, I gave our friend, Jack
Stuart, the trouble of delivering you a letter, and some
papers enclosed, which I was desirous to submit to your
criticism and examination. I say not this by way of compliment
and ceremonial, but seriously and in good earnest: it is
pretty usual for people to be pleased with their own
performance, especially in the heat of composition; but I have
scarcely wrote any thing more whimsical, or whose merit I am
more diffident of.</p>

<p>"But, in sending in these papers, I am afraid that <!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_322" id="Page_v1_322">[322]</a></span>I have not
taken the best step towards conveying them to your hand. I
should also have wrote you to ask for them, otherwise,
perhaps, our friend may wear them out in his pocket, and
forget the delivery of them: be so good, therefore, as to
desire them from him, and having read them at your leisure,
return them to him in a packet, and he will send them to me by
the carrier. You would easily observe what I mentioned to you,
that they had a reference to some other work, and were not
complete in themselves: but, with this allowance, are they
tolerable?"<a name="FNanchor_322:1_197" id="FNanchor_322:1_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_322:1_197" class="fnanchor">[322:1]</a></p>
</div>


<p>The paper to which the following letter refers, was published as an
appendix to the "Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals," to be
shortly noticed, and was simply termed, "A Dialogue." It is, perhaps,
more imaginative than any other of Hume's works, "The Epicurean" not
excepted. It draws startling contrasts, by taking from ancient and
modern times, two communities of men strikingly opposed to each other in
habits, and describing those of the one in the social language of the
other. In this manner, it gives an account of the vices of the Greeks,
in the manner in which they would be described by a modern fashionable
Englishman, seeking pleasure and companionship in Greece, as it was in
the days of Alcibiades. This method of exhibiting national manners
through the magnifying glass of national prejudices, has, in later
times, been frequently adopted,<a name="FNanchor_322:2_198" id="FNanchor_322:2_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_322:2_198" class="fnanchor">[322:2]</a> and, perhaps, owes its popularity
to the success with which it was exhibited in Montesquieu's "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres
Persanes</span>," and Goldsmith's "Citizen of the World."</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">February, 1751.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have read over your Dialogue, with all the
application I am master of. Though I have never looked into
any thing of your writing, which did not either entertain or
instruct me; yet, I must freely own to you, that I have
received from this last piece an additional satisfaction, and
what indeed I have a thousand times wished for in some of your
other performances. In the first part of this work, you have
given full scope to the native bent of your genius. The
ancients and moderns, how opposite soever in other respects,
equally combine in favour of the most unbounded scepticism.
Principles, customs, and manners, the most contradictory, all
seemingly lead to the same end; and agreeably to your laudable
practice, the poor reader is left in the most disconsolate
state of doubt and uncertainty. When I had got thus far, what
do you think were my sentiments? I will not be so candid as to
tell you; but how agreeable was my surprise, when I found you
had led me into this maze, with no other view, than to point
out to me more clearly the direct road. Why can't you always
write in this manner? Indulge yourself as much as you will in
starting difficulties, and perplexing received opinions: but
let us be convinced at length, that you have not less ability
to establish true principles, than subtlety to detect false
ones. This unphilosophical, or, if you will, this lazy
disposition of mine, you are at liberty to treat as you think
proper; yet am I no enemy to free inquiry, and I would gladly
flatter myself, no slave to prejudice or authority. I admit
also that there is no writing or talking of any subject that
is of importance enough to become the object of reasoning,
without having recourse to some degree of subtlety or
refinement. The only question is, where to stop,&mdash;how far we
can go, and why no farther. To this question I should be
extremely happy to receive a satisfactory answer. I can't tell
if I shall rightly express what I have just now in my mind:
but I often imagine to myself, that I perceive within me a
certain instinctive feeling, which shoves away at once all
subtle refinements, and tells me with authority, that these
air-built notions are inconsistent with life and experience,
and, by consequence <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_324" id="Page_v1_324">[324]</a></span>cannot be true or solid. From this I am
led to think, that the speculative principles of our nature
ought to go hand in hand with the practical ones; and, for my
own part, when the former are so far pushed, as to leave the
latter quite out of sight, I am always apt to suspect that we
have transgressed our limits. If it should be asked&mdash;how far
will these practical principles go? I can only answer, that
the former difficulty will recur, unless it be found that
there is something in the intellectual part of our nature,
resembling the moral sentiment in the moral part of our
nature, which determines this, as it were, instinctively. Very
possibly I have wrote nonsense. However, this notion first
occurred to me at London, in conversation with a man of some
depth of thinking; and talking of it since to your friend H.
Home, he seems to entertain some notions nearly of the same
kind, and to have pushed them much farther.</p>

<p>This is but an idle digression, so I return to the Dialogue.</p>

<p>With regard to the composition in general, I have nothing to
observe, as it appears to me to be conducted with the greatest
propriety, and the artifice in the beginning occasions, I
think, a very agreeable surprise. I don't know, if, in the
account of the modern manners, you [had] an eye to Bruyere's
introduction to his translation of Theophrastes.<a name="FNanchor_324:1_199" id="FNanchor_324:1_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_324:1_199" class="fnanchor">[324:1]</a> If you
had not, as he has a thought handled pretty much in that
manner, perhaps looking into it might furnish some farther
hints to embellish that part of your work.<a name="FNanchor_324:2_200" id="FNanchor_324:2_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_324:2_200" class="fnanchor">[324:2]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Ninewells, 19th February, 1751.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your notion of correcting subtlety of sentiment,
is certainly very just with regard to morals, which depend
upon sentiment; and in politics and natural philosophy,
whatever conclusion is contrary to certain matters of fact,
must certainly be wrong, <!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_325" id="Page_v1_325">[325]</a></span>and there must some error lie
somewhere in the argument, whether we be able to show it or
not. But in metaphysics or theology, I cannot see how either
of these plain and obvious standards of truth can have place.
Nothing there can correct bad reasoning but good reasoning,
and sophistry must be opposed by syllogisms. About seventy or
eighty years ago, I observe, a principle like that which you
advance prevailed very much in France among some philosophers
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beaux esprits</i>. The occasion of it was this: The famous
Mons. Nicole of the Port Royal, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Perpétuité de la
Foi</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_325:1_201" id="FNanchor_325:1_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_325:1_201" class="fnanchor">[325:1]</a> pushed the Protestants very hard upon the
impossibility of the people's reaching a conviction of their
religion by the way of private judgment; which required so
many disquisitions, reasonings, researches, eruditions,
impartiality, and penetration, as not one in a hundred even
among men of education, is capable of. Mons. Claude and the
Protestants answered him, not by solving his difficulties,
(which seems impossible,) but by retorting them, (which is
very easy.) They showed that to reach the way of authority
which the Catholics insist on, as long a train of acute
reasoning, and as great <!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_326" id="Page_v1_326">[326]</a></span>erudition, was requisite, as would be
sufficient for a Protestant. We must first prove all the
truths of natural religion, the foundation of morals, the
divine authority of the Scripture, the deference which it
commands to the church, the tradition of the church, &amp;c. The
comparison of these controversial writings begot an idea in
some, that it was neither by reasoning nor authority we learn
our religion, but by sentiment: and certainly this were a very
convenient way, and what a philosopher would be very well
pleased to comply with, if he could distinguish sentiment from
education. But to all appearance the sentiment of Stockholm,
Geneva, Rome ancient and modern, Athens and Memphis, have the
same characters; and no sensible man can implicitly assent to
any of them, but from the general principle, that as the truth
in these subjects is beyond human capacity, and that as for
one's own ease he must adopt some tenets, there is most
satisfaction and convenience in holding to the Catholicism we
have been first taught. Now this I have nothing to say
against. I have only to observe, that such a conduct is
founded on the most universal and determined scepticism,
joined to a little indolence; for more curiosity and research
gives a direct opposite turn from the same principles.</p>

<p>"I have amused myself lately with an essay or dissertation on
the populousness of antiquity, which led me into many
disquisitions concerning both the public and domestic life of
the ancients. Having read over almost all the classics both
Greek and Latin, since I formed that plan, I have extracted
what served most to my purpose. But I have not a Strabo, and
know not where to get one in this neighbourhood. He is an
author I never read. I know your library&mdash;I mean the
Advocates'&mdash;is scrupulous of lending classics; but <!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_327" id="Page_v1_327">[327]</a></span>perhaps
that difficulty may be got over. I should be much obliged to
you, if you could procure me the loan of a copy, either in the
original language or even in a good translation.</p>

<p>"The Greeks had military dances, particularly the Pyrrhicha;
but these were not practised in their festivals nor amidst
their jollity. Their way of dancing was very good for an
indolent fellow; for commonly they rose not from their seats,
but moved their arms and head in cadence. 'Tis difficult to
imagine there could be much grace in that kind of dancing.</p>

<p>"I send you enclosed a little endeavour at drollery, against
some people who care not much to be joked upon.<a name="FNanchor_327:1_202" id="FNanchor_327:1_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_327:1_202" class="fnanchor">[327:1]</a> I have
frequently had it in my intentions to write a supplement to
Gulliver, containing the ridicule of priests. 'Twas certainly
a pity that Swift was a parson; had he been a lawyer or
physician, we had nevertheless been entertained at the expense
of these professions: but priests are so jealous, that they
cannot bear to be touched on that head, and for a plain
reason, because they are conscious they are really ridiculous.
That part of the Doctor's subject is so fertile, that a much
inferior genius I am confident might succeed in it.</p>

<p>"Tell Jack Stuart, as soon as you see him, that I have sent
you the copy, if he can make any thing of it. I intended to
have had it printed, but I know not how&mdash;I find it will not
do. If you like the thing, I wish you would contrive together

<p>Among the papers submitted to the inspection of <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_328" id="Page_v1_328">[328]</a></span>Mr. Elliot, were the
"Dialogues concerning Natural Religion," which were not published until
after their author's death, but which the following letter shows to have
been written before the year 1751. The manuscript of this work<a name="FNanchor_328:1_204" id="FNanchor_328:1_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:1_204" class="fnanchor">[328:1]</a> is
full of emendations and corrections; and while the sentiments appear to
be substantially the same as when they were first set down, the
alterations in the method of announcing them are a register of the
improvements in their author's style, for a period apparently of
twenty-seven years. Here at least he could not plead the excuse of youth
and indiscretion. The work, penned in the full vigour of his faculties,
comes to us with the sanction of his mature years, and his approval when
he was within sight of the grave. Whatever sentiments, therefore, in
this work, may be justly found to excite censure, carry with them a
reproach from which their author's name cannot escape.</p>

<p>The Dialogues are written with a solemn simplicity of tone worthy of the
character of the subject. The structure is in a great measure that of
Cicero, though there appears not, as there generally does in the
conversations professed to be recorded by the Roman moralist, any one
mind completely predominating over the others. Of the interlocutors,
Philo presents himself, at first as a materialist of the Spinoza school,
who finds that the material world has within itself the principles of
its own motion and development&mdash;the operating causes that produce its
phenomena; while he denies that these phenomena exhibit an all perfect
structure. He is not, however, a man of settled opinions, but rather a
sceptical demolisher of other people's views; and we find him saying, "I
must confess that <!-- Page 329 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_329" id="Page_v1_329">[329]</a></span>I am less cautious on the subject of natural religion
than on any other; both because I know that I can never, on that head,
corrupt the principles of any man of common sense; and because no one, I
am confident, in whose eyes I appear a man of common sense, will ever
mistake my intentions. You in particular, Cleanthes, with whom I live in
unreserved intimacy, you are sensible, that notwithstanding the freedom
of my conversation, and my love of singular arguments, no one has a
deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, or pays more profound
adoration to the Divine Being, as he discovers himself to reason, in the
inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature."</p>

<p>Cleanthes, another speaker, has created a natural religion of his own&mdash;a
system of Theism, in which, by induction from the beautiful order and
mechanism of the world, he has reasoned himself into the belief of an
all-wise and all-powerful Supreme Being. He holds, that "the most
agreeable reflection which it is possible for human imagination to
suggest, is that of genuine Theism, which represents us as the
workmanship of a being perfectly good, wise, and powerful, who created
us for happiness; and who, having implanted in us immeasurable desires
of good, will prolong our existence to all eternity, and will transfer
us into an infinite variety of scenes, in order to satisfy those
desires, and render our felicity complete and durable." And, strangely
enough, it is with this one that the author shows most sympathy, very
nearly professing that the doctrine announced by Cleanthes is his own;
while it will be found in his correspondence, that he admits his having
designedly endeavoured to make the argument of that speaker the most
attractive. This is another illustration of the inapplicability of
perfectly abstract metaphysical disquisitions to <!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_330" id="Page_v1_330">[330]</a></span>religious faith; for,
if there is any system of religion that is incompatible with Hume's
metaphysical opinions on ideas and impressions, it is a system that is,
like this of Cleanthes, the workmanship of human reason. The third
speaker, Demea, is a devoutly religious man, who, not venturing to
create a system of belief for himself, sees in the order of the world
such a merciful and wise dispensation of Divine Providence, as induces
him to receive the whole revealed scheme of religion without questioning
those parts of it which are beyond his comprehension, any more than he
questions those of which the wisdom and goodness are immediately
apparent.</p>

<p>The general scope and purport of the Dialogues are not unlike those of
Voltaire's Jenni. In both, the argument on natural theology,
illustrating the existence of a ruling mind from the general order and
harmony of created things, is adduced, and is measured with its
counterpart, the argument from the imperfection of earthly things, and
the calamities and unhappiness of the beings standing at the head of the
whole social order, mankind. But in the mere similarity of the argument
the resemblance stops; no two performances can be more unlike each other
in tone and spirit than the English sceptic's honest search after truth,
and the French infidel's ribald sport with all that men love and revere.
The contrast may be found not only in these individual men, but in the
two classes of thinkers at the head of which they respectively stood.
Hume represented the cautious conscientious inquiry, which has
established many truths and gradually ameliorated social evils; the
Frenchman directed that scornful, careless, and cruel sport with
whatever is dear and important to humanity, which one day bowed to
absolute <!-- Page 331 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_331" id="Page_v1_331">[331]</a></span>despotism, and the next destroyed the whole fabric of social
order.<a name="FNanchor_331:1_205" id="FNanchor_331:1_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_331:1_205" class="fnanchor">[331:1]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Ninewells, near Berwick,<br />
March 10, 1751.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You would perceive by the sample I have given you,
that I make Cleanthes the hero of the dialogue: whatever you
can think of, to strengthen that side of the argument, will be
most acceptable to <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_332" id="Page_v1_332">[332]</a></span>me. Any propensity you imagine I have to
the other side, crept in upon me against my will; and 'tis not
long ago that I burned an old manuscript book, wrote before I
was twenty, which contained, page after page, the gradual
progress of my thoughts on that head. It began with an anxious
search after arguments, to confirm the common opinion; doubts
stole in, dissipated, returned; were again dissipated,
returned again; and it was a perpetual struggle of a restless
imagination against inclination, perhaps against reason.</p>

<p>"I have often thought, that the best way of composing a
dialogue, would be for two persons that are of different
opinions about any question of importance, to write
alternately the different parts of the discourse, and reply to
each other: by this means, that vulgar error would be avoided,
of putting nothing but nonsense into the mouth of the
adversary; and at the same time, a variety of character and
genius being upheld, would make the whole look more natural
and unaffected. Had it been my good fortune to live near you,
I should have taken on me the character of Philo, in the
dialogue, which you'll own I could have supported naturally
enough; and you would not have been averse to that of
Cleanthes. I believe, too, we could both of us have kept our
tempers very well; only, you have not reached an absolute
philosophical indifference on these points. What danger can
ever come from ingenious reasoning and inquiry? The worst
speculative sceptic ever I knew, was a much better man than
the best superstitious devotee and bigot. I must inform you,
too, that this was the way of thinking of the ancients on this
subject. If a man made a profession of philosophy, whatever
his sect was, they always expected to find more regularity <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_333" id="Page_v1_333">[333]</a></span>in
his life and manners, than in those of the ignorant and
illiterate. There is a remarkable passage of Appian to this
purpose. That historian observes, that notwithstanding the
established prepossession in favour of learning, yet some
philosophers, who have been trusted with absolute power, have
very much abused it; and he instances Critias, the most
violent of the thirty, and Ariston, who governed Athens in the
time of Sylla: but I find, upon inquiry, that Critias was a
professed Atheist, and Ariston an Epicurean, which is little
or nothing different. And yet Appian wonders at their
corruption, as much as if they had been Stoics or Platonists.
A modern zealot would have thought that corruption
unavoidable.</p>

<p>"I could wish Cleanthes' argument could be so analyzed, as to
be rendered quite formal and regular. The propensity of the
mind towards it,&mdash;unless that propensity were as strong and
universal as that to believe in our senses and
experience,&mdash;will still, I am afraid, be esteemed a suspicious
foundation. 'Tis here I wish for your assistance; we must
endeavour to prove that this propensity is somewhat different
from our inclination to find our own figures in the clouds,
our faces in the moon, our passions and sentiments even in
inanimate matter. Such an inclination may, and ought to be
controlled, and can never be a legitimate ground of assent.</p>

<p>"The instances I have chosen for Cleanthes are, I hope,
tolerably happy, and the confusion in which I represent the
sceptic seems natural, but&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">si quid novisti rectius</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"You ask me, '<em>If the idea of cause and effect is nothing but
vicinity</em>,' (you should have said constant vicinity, or,
regular conjunction,) I should be glad to know <em>whence is that
farther idea of causation against <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_334" id="Page_v1_334">[334]</a></span>which you argue</em>? This
question is pertinent, but I hope I have answered it; we feel,
after the constant conjunction, an easy transition from one
idea to the other, or a connexion in the imagination; and as
it is usual for us to transfer our own feelings to the objects
on which they are dependent, we attach the internal sentiment
to the external objects. If no single instances of cause and
effect appear to have any connexion, but only repeated similar
ones, you will find yourself obliged to have recourse to this
theory.</p>

<p>"I am sorry our correspondence should lead us into these
abstract speculations. I have thought, and read, and composed
very little on such questions of late. Morals, Politics, and
Literature have employed all my time; but still the other
topics I must think more curious, important, entertaining, and
useful, than any geometry that is deeper than Euclid. If in
order to answer the doubts started, new principles of
philosophy must be laid, are not these doubts themselves very
useful? Are they not preferable to blind, and ignorant assent?
I hope I can answer my own doubts; but if I could not, is it
to be wondered at? To give myself airs, and speak
magnificently, might I not observe, that Columbus did not
conquer empires and plant colonies?</p>

<p>"If I have not unravelled the knot so well, in those last
papers I sent you, as perhaps I did in the former, it has not,
I assure you, proceeded from want of good will; but some
subjects are easier than others: at some times one is happier
in his researches and inquiries than at others. Still I have
recourse to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">si quid novisti rectius</i>; not in order to pay
you a compliment, but from a real philosophical doubt and
curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_334:1_206" id="FNanchor_334:1_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:1_206" class="fnanchor">[334:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_335" id="Page_v1_335">[335]</a></span>"I do not pay compliments, because I do not desire them. For
this reason, I am very well pleased you speak so coldly of my
petition. I had, however, given orders to have it printed,
which perhaps may be executed, though I believe I had better
have let it alone; not because it will give you offence, but
because it will give no entertainment; not because it may be
called profane, but because it may perhaps be deservedly
called dull. To tell the truth, I was always so indifferent
about fortune, and especially now, that I am more advanced in
life, and am a little more at my ease, suited to my extreme
frugality, that I neither fear nor hope any thing from man;
and am very indifferent either about offence or favour. Not
only, I would not sacrifice truth and reason to political
views, but scarce even a jest. You may tell me, I ought to
have reversed the order of these points, and put the jest
first: as it is usual for people to be the fondest of their
performances on subjects on which they are least made to
excel, and that, consequently, I would give more to be thought
a good droll, than to have the praises of erudition, and
subtilty, and invention.&mdash;This malicious insinuation, I will
give no answer to, but proceed with my subject.</p>

<p>"I find, however, I have no more to say on it, but to thank
you for <em>Strabo</em>. If the carrier who will deliver this to you
do not find you at home, you will please send the book to his
quarters; his name is Thomas Henderson, the Berwick carrier;
he leaves town on the Thursdays, about the middle of the day;
he puts up at James Henderson, stabler, betwixt the foot of
Cant's Close and Blackfriar's Wynd. After you have done with
these papers, please return them by the same carrier; but
there is no hurry; on the contrary the longer you keep them, I
shall still believe you <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_336" id="Page_v1_336">[336]</a></span>are thinking the more seriously to
execute what I desire of you. I am, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="author">"Yours most sincerely."</p>

<p class="section">"P.S.&mdash;If you'll be persuaded to assist me with Cleanthes, I
fancy you need not take matters any higher than part 3d. He
allows, indeed, in part 2d, that all our inference is founded
on the similitude of the works of nature to the usual effects
of mind, otherwise they must appear a mere chaos. The only
difficulty is, why the other assimilations do not weaken the
argument; and indeed it would seem from experience and
feeling, that they do not weaken it so much as we might
naturally expect. A theory to solve this would be very
acceptable."<a name="FNanchor_336:1_207" id="FNanchor_336:1_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_336:1_207" class="fnanchor">[336:1]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">1751.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am sorry your keeping these papers has proceeded
from business and avocations, and not from your endeavours to
clear up so difficult an argument. I despair not, however, of
getting some assistance from you; the subject is surely of the
greatest <!-- Page 337 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_337" id="Page_v1_337">[337]</a></span>importance, and the views of it so new as to
challenge some attention.</p>

<p>"I believe the Philosophical Essays contain every thing of
consequence relating to the understanding, which you would
meet with in the Treatise; and I give you my advice against
reading the latter. By shortening and simplifying the
questions, I really render them much more complete. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Addo dum
minuo.</i> The philosophical principles are the same in both; but
I was carried away by the heat of youth and invention to
publish too precipitately.&mdash;So vast an undertaking, planned
before I was one-and-twenty, and composed before twenty-five,
must necessarily be very defective. I have repented my haste a
hundred, and a hundred times.</p>

<p>"I return Strabo, whom I have found very judicious and useful.
I give you a great many thanks for your trouble. I am," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Hume's elder brother, John, the laird of Ninewells, was married in 1751;
and the following letter, enlivened by touches of light and even elegant
raillery, scarcely excelled in the writings of Addison, evidently refers
to that event. The plan of life which he sets forth was afterwards
altered, at least in so far as he had then in view a place of residence.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dysart</span>.<a name="FNanchor_337:1_208" id="FNanchor_337:1_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:1_208" class="fnanchor">[337:1]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Ninewells, March 19th, 1751.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;Our friend at last plucked up a resolution, and
has ventured on that dangerous encounter. He went off on
Monday morning; and this is the first action of his life
wherein he has engaged <!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_338" id="Page_v1_338">[338]</a></span>himself, without being able to compute
exactly the consequences. But what arithmetic will serve to
fix the proportion between good and bad wives, and rate the
different classes of each? Sir Isaac Newton himself, who could
measure the course of the planets, and weigh the earth as in a
pair of scales,&mdash;even he had not algebra enough to reduce that
amiable part of our species to a just equation; and they are
the only heavenly bodies whose orbits are as yet uncertain.</p>

<p>"If you think yourself too grave a matron to have this florid
part of the speech addressed to you, pray lend it to the
Collector, and he will send it to Miss Nancy.</p>

<p>"Since my brother's departure, Katty and I have been computing
in our turn, and the result of our deliberation is, that we
are to take up house in Berwick; where, if arithmetic and
frugality don't deceive us, (and they are pretty certain arts)
we shall be able, after providing for hunger, warmth, and
cleanliness, to keep a stock in reserve, which we may
afterwards turn either to the purposes of hoarding, luxury, or
charity. But I have declared beforehand against the first; I
can easily guess which of the other two you and Mr. Dysart
will be most favourable to. But we reject your judgment; for
nothing blinds one so much as inveterate habits.</p>

<p>"My compliments to his Solicitorship.<a name="FNanchor_338:1_209" id="FNanchor_338:1_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_338:1_209" class="fnanchor">[338:1]</a> Unfortunately I
have not a horse at present to carry my fat carcass, to pay
its respects to his superior obesity. But if he finds
travelling requisite either for his health or the captain's,
we shall be glad to entertain him here, as long as we can do
it at another's expense; in hopes we shall soon be able to do
it at our own.</p>

<p><!-- Page 339 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_339" id="Page_v1_339">[339]</a></span>"Pray tell the Solicitor that I have been reading lately, in
an old author called <em>Strabo</em>, that in some cities of ancient
Gaul, there was a fixed legal standard established for
corpulency; and that the senate kept a measure, beyond which,
if any belly presumed to increase, the proprietor of that
belly was obliged to pay a fine to the public, proportionable
to its rotundity. Ill would it fare with his worship and
I,<a name="FNanchor_339:1_210" id="FNanchor_339:1_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_339:1_210" class="fnanchor">[339:1]</a> if such a law should pass our parliament; for I am
afraid we are already got beyond the statute.</p>

<p>"I wonder, indeed, no harpy of the treasury has ever thought
of this method of raising money. Taxes on luxury are always
most approved of; and no one will say, that the carrying about
a portly belly is of any use or necessity. 'Tis a mere
superfluous ornament; and is a proof, too, that its proprietor
enjoys greater plenty than he puts to a good use; and,
therefore, 'tis fit to reduce him to a level with his
fellow-subjects, by taxes and impositions.</p>

<p>"As the lean people are the most active, unquiet, and
ambitious, they every where govern the world, and may
certainly oppress their antagonists whenever they please.
Heaven forbid that Whig and Tory should ever be abolished; for
then the nation might be split into fat and lean; and our
faction, I am afraid, would be in piteous taking. The only
comfort is, if they oppressed us very much, we should at last
change sides with them.</p>

<p>"Besides, who knows if a tax were imposed on fatness, but some
jealous divine might pretend that the church was in danger.</p>

<p>"I cannot but bless the memory of Julius Cæsar, for the great
esteem he expressed for fat men, and his aversion to lean
ones. All the world allows, that <!-- Page 340 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_340" id="Page_v1_340">[340]</a></span>that emperor was the
greatest genius that ever was, and the greatest judge of
mankind.</p>

<p>"But I should ask your pardon, dear madam, for this long
dissertation on fatness and leanness, in which you are no way
concerned; for you are neither fat nor lean, and may indeed be
denominated an arrant trimmer. But this letter may all be read
to the Solicitor; for it contains nothing that need be a
secret to him. On the contrary, I hope he will profit by the
example; and, were I near him, I should endeavour to prove as
good an encourager as in this other instance. What can the man
be afraid of? The Mayor of London had more courage, who defied
the hare.<a name="FNanchor_340:1_211" id="FNanchor_340:1_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:1_211" class="fnanchor">[340:1]</a></p>

<p>"But I am resolved some time to conclude, by putting a grave
epilogue to a farce, and telling you a real serious truth,
that I am, with great esteem, dear madam, your most obedient
humble servant.<a name="FNanchor_340:2_212" id="FNanchor_340:2_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:2_212" class="fnanchor">[340:2]</a></p>

his silence."</p>

<p>We find, through the whole of his acts and written thoughts before his
return from the embassy to Turin, the indications of an earnest wish to
possess the means of independent livelihood, suitable to one belonging
to the middle classes of life. Great wealth or ornamental rank he seems
never to have desired: but the circumstance of his having, in the year
1748, achieved the means of independence through his official
emoluments, seems to have taken so strong a hold of his mind, that
nearly thirty years afterwards, <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_341" id="Page_v1_341">[341]</a></span>in writing his autobiography, he speaks
with exultation of his having been then in possession of £1000. The
position of the man in comfortable circumstances, equally removed from
the dread of want, and the uneasy pressure of superfluous wealth,
appears always to have presented itself as the most desirable fate
which, in mere pecuniary matters, fortune could have in store for him;
and no commentary on the sacred text has perhaps better illustrated its
application to the conduct and feelings of mankind, than his adaptation
of Agur's prayer to the middle station in life, at a time when he was
far from having realized that happy mediocrity of fortune, of which he
gives so pleasing a picture.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Agur's prayer is sufficiently noted&mdash;"Two things have I
required of thee; deny me them not before I die: remove far
from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches;
feed me with food convenient for me, lest I be full and deny
thee, and say, who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal,
and take the name of my God in vain."&mdash;The middle station is
here justly recommended, as affording the fullest security for
virtue; and I may also add, that it gives opportunity for the
most ample exercise of it, and furnishes employment for every
good quality which we can possibly be possessed of. Those who
are placed among the lower ranks of men, have little
opportunity of exerting any other virtue besides those of
patience, resignation, industry, and integrity. Those who are
advanced into the higher stations, have full employment for
their generosity, humanity, affability, and charity. When a
man lies betwixt these two extremes, he can exert the former
virtues towards his superiors, and the latter towards his
inferiors. Every moral quality which the human soul is
susceptible of, may have its turn, and be called up to action;
and a man may, after this manner, be much more certain of his
progress in virtue, than where his good qualities lie dormant,
and without employment.<a name="FNanchor_341:1_213" id="FNanchor_341:1_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_341:1_213" class="fnanchor">[341:1]</a></p>

definitive intentions.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Michael Ramsay</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Ninewells, 22d June, 1751.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Michael</span>,&mdash;I cannot sufficiently express my sense of your
kind letter. The concern you take in your friends is so warm,
even after so long absence, and such frequent interruptions as
our commerce has unhappily met with of late years, that the
most recent familiarity of others can seldom equal it. I might
perhaps pretend, as well as others, to complain of fortune;
but I do not, and should condemn myself as unreasonable if I
did. While interest remains as at present, I have £50 a-year,
a hundred pounds worth of books, great store of linens and
fine clothes, and near £100 in my pocket; along with order,
frugality, a strong spirit of independency, good health, a
contented humour, and an unabating love of study. In these
circumstances I must esteem myself one of the happy and
fortunate; and so far from being willing to draw my ticket
over again in the lottery of life, there are very few prizes
with which I would make an exchange. After some deliberation,
I am resolved to settle in Edinburgh, and hope I shall be able
with these revenues to say with Horace&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Besides other reasons which determine me to this resolution, I
would not go too far away from my sister, who thinks she will
soon follow me; and in that case, we shall probably take up
house either in Edinburgh, or the neighbourhood. Our
sister-in-law behaves well, and seems very desirous we should
both stay.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <!-- Page 343 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_343" id="Page_v1_343">[343]</a></span>And as she (my sister) can join £30 a-year to
my stock, and brings an equal love of order and frugality, we
doubt not to make our revenues answer. Dr. Clephane, who has
taken up house, is so kind as to offer me a room in it; and
two friends in Edinburgh have made me the same offer. But
having nothing to ask or solicit at London, I would not remove
to so expensive a place; and am resolved to keep clear of all
obligations and dependencies, even on those I love the
most."<a name="FNanchor_343:1_214" id="FNanchor_343:1_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:1_214" class="fnanchor">[343:1]</a></p>

<p>In fulfilment of the design thus announced, he tells us, in his "own
life," "In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true scene
for a man of letters." We find, from the dating of his letters, that
Hume's residence in Edinburgh was for a year or two in "Riddell's Land,"
and that it was afterwards in "Jack's Land." Since the plan of numbering
the houses in each street extended to the Scottish capital, these names
have no longer been in general use; but I find that the former applied
to an edifice in the Lawnmarket, near the head of the West Bow, and that
the latter was a tenement in the Canongate, right opposite to a house in
which Smollet occasionally resided with his sister. The term "Land"
applied to one of those edifices&mdash;some of them ten or twelve stories
high,&mdash;in which the citizens of Edinburgh, pressed upwards as it were by
the increase of the population within a narrow circuit of walls, made
stair-cases supply the place of streets, and erected perpendicular
thoroughfares. A single floor of one of these edifices was, a century
ago, sufficient to accommodate the family of a <!-- Page 344 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_344" id="Page_v1_344">[344]</a></span>Scottish nobleman; and
we may be certain, that a very small "Flat" would suit the economical
establishment of Hume.</p>

<p>In 1751, appeared the "Inquiry concerning the Principles of
Morals,"<a name="FNanchor_344:1_215" id="FNanchor_344:1_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_344:1_215" class="fnanchor">[344:1]</a> the full development, so far as it was made by Hume, of
the utilitarian system. The leading principle kept in view throughout
this work, is, that its tendency to be useful to mankind at large, is
the proper criterion of the propriety of any action, or the justness of
any ethical opinion. In this spirit he examines many of the social
virtues, and shows that it is their usefulness to mankind that gives
them a claim to sympathy, and a title to be included in the list of
virtues. The defects of this exposition of the utilitarian system, are
marked by the manner in which it was critically attacked. In 1753 a
controversial examination of it was made, with temper and ability, by
James Balfour of Pilrig,<a name="FNanchor_344:2_216" id="FNanchor_344:2_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_344:2_216" class="fnanchor">[344:2]</a> who in 1754 succeeded <!-- Page 345 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_345" id="Page_v1_345">[345]</a></span>to the chair, in
the university of Edinburgh, which Hume had been desirous of
filling.<a name="FNanchor_345:1_217" id="FNanchor_345:1_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_345:1_217" class="fnanchor">[345:1]</a> Mr. Balfour's great argument is the universality of the
admission by <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_346" id="Page_v1_346">[346]</a></span>mankind, in some shape or other, of the leading cardinal
virtues, and the unhesitating adoption and practice of them by men on
whom the utilitarian theory never dawned, and who are unconscious that
their isolated acts are the fulfilment of any general or uniform law.
Mr. Balfour argued that we must thus look to something else than
utility, as the criterion of moral right and wrong. But a supporter of
the utilitarian system, as it has been more fully developed in later
days, would probably only take from Mr. Balfour's argument a hint to
enlarge the scope of Hume's investigations. To the inquiry, how far
utility is the proper end of human conduct, he would add the inquiry,
how far the theory has been practically adopted by mankind at large.
Though Bacon first laid down the broad rule of unvarying induction from
experiment, many experiments were made, and many inductions derived from
them, before he saw the light; and so before the utilitarian theory was
first formally suggested&mdash;as it appears to have been by Aristotle in his
Nicomachean Ethics&mdash;utility may frequently have been a rule of action.</p>

<p>It does not necessarily follow, that because a practice is universal,
because it is adopted "by saint, by savage, and by sage," it is
therefore not the dictate of utility, provided it be admitted that
utility was an influencing motive with men before the days of Hume. The
followers of established customs may often be blind; but if we hunt back
a practice to its first institution, we may find that the leaders were
quick-sighted, and kept utility in view, so far as the state of things
they had to deal with permitted. A minute <!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_347" id="Page_v1_347">[347]</a></span>inquiry into national
prejudices and customs frequently surprises the speculative philosopher,
by developing these practices and opinions of the vulgar and illiterate,
as the fruit of great knowledge and forethought. Exhibiting, in their
full extravagance, the contrasts between different codes of morality,
was one of Hume's literary recreations; and it might have been worth his
while to have inquired, had it occurred to him, how much of his own
favourite utilitarian principle is common to all, or at least to many,
of the systems he has thus contrasted with each other.</p>

<p>It was a consequence, perhaps, of the limited extent to which he had
carried the utilitarian theory, that Hume was charged with having left
no distinct line between talent and virtue. By making it seem as if he
held that each man was virtuous according as he did good to mankind at
large, and vicious in as far as he failed in accomplishing this end, he
made way for the argument, that no man can rise high in virtue, unless
he also rise high in intellectual gifts; since, without possessing the
latter, he is not capable of deciding what actions are, and what are
not, conducive to the good of the human race. Many sentiments expressed
in the Inquiry appeared to justify this charge.<a name="FNanchor_347:1_218" id="FNanchor_347:1_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_347:1_218" class="fnanchor">[347:1]</a> There was thus no
merit assigned to what is called good intention; and no ground for
extending the just approbation of mankind to those who have never
attempted to frame a code of morality to themselves, but who, following
the track of established opinions, or the rules laid down by some of the
many leaders of the human race, believe that, by a steadfast <!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_348" id="Page_v1_348">[348]</a></span>and
disinterested pursuit of their adopted course, they are doing that which
is right in the eye of God and man. It is certain, however, that in this
way many a man may be pursuing a line of conduct conducive to the good
of his fellow-creatures, without knowing that his actions have that
ultimate end. While he follows the rules that have been laid down for
him, his code of morality may be as far superior to that of his clever
and aspiring neighbour, who has fabricated a system for himself, as the
intelligence of the leader, followed by the one, is greater than the
self-sufficient wisdom of the other. Hence multitudes in the humblest
classes of society, in any well regulated community of modern Europe,
will be found, almost blindly, following a code of morality as much
above what the genius either of Socrates or Cicero could devise, as the
order of the universe is superior to the greatest efforts of man's
artificial skill.</p>

<p><!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_349" id="Page_v1_349">[349]</a></span>It was, perhaps, from a like want of inquiry into the full extent of the
system, that his theory of utility encountered the charge of being a
mere system of "expediency," which estimated actions according as they
accomplished what appeared at the moment to be good or evil, without any
regard to their ultimate consequences. He certainly left for Bentham the
task of making a material addition to the utilitarian theory, by
applying it to the secondary effects of actions. Thus, according to
Bentham's view, when a successful highway robbery is committed, the
direct evil done to the victim is but a part of the mischief
accomplished. The secondary effects have an operation, if not so deep,
yet very widely spread, in creating terror, anxiety, and distrust on the
part of honest people, and emboldening the wicked to the perpetration of
crimes. On the same principle a good measure must not be carried through
the legislature by corrupt means; because the example so set, will, in
the end, though not perhaps till the generation benefited by the measure
has passed away, produce more bad measures than good, by lowering the
tone of political morality. Had Hume kept in view these secondary
effects, he never would have vindicated suicide, thought sudden death an
occurrence rather fortunate than otherwise, or used expressions from
which an opponent could with any plausibility infer, that, under any
circumstances, he held strict female chastity in light esteem. But he
was always careless about the offensive application of his principles;
forgetting that if there be any thing in a set of opinions calculated
deeply and permanently to outrage the feelings of mankind, the
probability at least is, that they have something about them
unsound,&mdash;that the mass of the public are right, and the solitary
philosopher wrong.</p>

<p><!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_350" id="Page_v1_350">[350]</a></span>Hume's account, in his "own life," of this period of his literary
history, is contained in the following paragraph, in which, as in some
other instances, it will be seen that his memory has not accurately
retained the chronological sequence of his works.</p>

<p>"In 1752, were published at Edinburgh, where I then lived, my 'Political
Discourses,' the only work of mine that was successful on the first
publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the same year
was published at London, my 'Inquiry concerning the Principles of
Morals;' which, in my own opinion, (who ought not to judge on that
subject,) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary,
incomparably the best. It came unnoticed and unobserved into the world."</p>

<p>Before noticing the "Political Discourses," it is necessary to state,
that during this winter of 1751, we find Hume again attempting to obtain
an academic chair, and again disappointed. Adam Smith, having been
Professor of Logic in the university of Glasgow, succeeded to the chair
of Moral Philosophy in November 1751, on the death of Professor Craigie,
its former occupant. That Hume used considerable exertions to be
appointed Smith's successor, is attested by some incidental passages in
his correspondence, and particularly by the following letter to Dr.
Cullen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 21st January, 1752.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The part which you have acted in the late project for
my election into your college, gave me so much pleasure, that
I would do myself the greatest violence did I not take every
opportunity of expressing my most lively sense of it. We have
failed, and are thereby deprived of great opportunities of
cultivating that friendship, which had so happily <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_351" id="Page_v1_351">[351]</a></span>commenced
by your zeal for my interests. But I hope other opportunities
will offer; and I assure you, that nothing will give me
greater pleasure than an intimacy with a person of your merit.
You must even allow me to count upon the same privilege of
friendship, as if I had enjoyed the happiness of a longer
correspondence and familiarity with you; for as it is a common
observation, that the conferring favours on another is the
surest method of attaching us to him, I must, by this rule,
consider you as a person to whom my interests can never be
altogether indifferent. Whatever the reverend gentlemen may
say of my religion, I hope I have as much morality as to
retain a grateful sentiment of your favours, and as much sense
as to know whose friendship will give greatest honour and
advantage to me. I am," &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>The distinguished scientific man, in the course of whose researches this
curious literary incident was divulged, informs us that Burke was also a
candidate for this chair,<a name="FNanchor_351:1_219" id="FNanchor_351:1_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_351:1_219" class="fnanchor">[351:1]</a> and that the successful competitor was
a Mr. Clow. Concerning this fortunate person literary history is silent;
but he has acquired a curious title to fame, from the greatness of the
man to whom he succeeded, and of those over whom he was triumphant.</p>

<p>It is not, perhaps, to be regretted, that Hume failed in both his
attempts to obtain a professor's chair. <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_352" id="Page_v1_352">[352]</a></span>He was not of the stuff that
satisfactory teachers of youth are made of. Although he was beyond all
doubt an able man of business, in matters sufficiently important to
command his earnest attention, yet it is pretty clear that he had
acquired the outward manner of an absent, good-natured man, unconscious
of much that was going on around him; and that he would have thus
afforded a butt to the mischief and raillery of his pupils, from which
all the lustre of his philosophical reputation would not have protected
him.</p>

<p>Discoverers do not make, in ordinary circumstances, the best instructors
of youth, because their minds are often too full of the fermentation of
their own original ideas and partly developed systems, to possess the
coolness and clearness necessary for conveying a distinct view of the
laws and elements of an established system. But if this may be an
incidental inconvenience in one whose discoveries are but extensions of
admitted doctrines, the revolutionist who is endeavouring to pull to
pieces what has been taught for ages within the same walls, and to erect
a new system in its stead, can scarcely ever be a satisfactory
instructor of any considerable number of young men. The teacher of the
moral department of science especially must be, to a certain extent, a
conformist; if he be not, what is taught in the class-room will be
forgotten or contradicted in the closet. The teachers of youth are
themselves not less irascible and sometimes not less prejudiced than
other mortals. They have their hatreds and partisanships, often
productive of acrimonious controversy; but when there is something like
a unity of opinion in the systems of those who teach the same, or like
subjects, these superficial discussions produce no evil fruit. Hume
would have been at <!-- Page 353 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_353" id="Page_v1_353">[353]</a></span>peace with all who would have let his unobtrusive
spirit alone; but he would probably have quietly proceeded to inculcate
doctrines to which most of his fellow-labourers were strongly averse;
and that, perhaps, without knowing or feeling that he was in any way
departing from the simple routine of duties which the public expected of
him. And thus he would probably have created in the midst of the rising
youth of the day, an isolated circle of disciples, taught to despise the
acquirements and opinions of their contemporaries, as these
contemporaries held theirs in abhorrence.<a name="FNanchor_353:1_220" id="FNanchor_353:1_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_353:1_220" class="fnanchor">[353:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 354 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_354" id="Page_v1_354">[354]</a></span>This was an important epoch in Hume's literary history; in 1751, he
produced the work which he himself considered the most meritorious of
all his efforts; in 1752, he published that which obtained the largest
amount of contemporary popularity, the "Political Discourses."<a name="FNanchor_354:1_221" id="FNanchor_354:1_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:1_221" class="fnanchor">[354:1]</a>
After a series of literary disappointments, borne with the spirit of one
who felt within him the real powers of an original thinker and an
agreeable writer, and the assurance that the world would some day
acknowledge the sterling greatness of his qualifications, he now at last
presented them in a form, in which they received the ready homage of the
public. These Discourses are in truth the cradle of political economy;
and, much as that science has been investigated and expounded in later
times, these earliest, shortest, and simplest developments of its
principles are still read with delight even by those who are masters of
all the literature of this great subject.<a name="FNanchor_354:2_222" id="FNanchor_354:2_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:2_222" class="fnanchor">[354:2]</a> But they <!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_355" id="Page_v1_355">[355]</a></span>possess a
quality which more elaborate economists have striven after in vain, in
being a pleasing object of study not only to the initiated but to the
ordinary popular reader, and of being admitted as just and true by many
who cannot or who will not understand the views of later writers on
political economy.<a name="FNanchor_355:1_223" id="FNanchor_355:1_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_355:1_223" class="fnanchor">[355:1]</a> They have thus the rarely conjoined merit,
that, as they were the first to direct the way to the true sources of
this department of knowledge, those who have gone farther, instead of
superseding them, have in the general case confirmed their accuracy.</p>

<p>Political economy is a science of which the advanced extremities are the
subject of debate and doubt, while the older doctrines are admitted by
all as firm and established truths. It may be slippery ground, but it is
not a tread-mill, and no step taken has ever to be entirely retraced. It
is owing to this characteristic of the science that those who oppose the
doctrines of modern economists do not think of denying those of David
Hume; and thus, while in these essays the economist finds some of the
most important doctrines of his peculiar subject set forth with a
clearness and elegance with which he dare not attempt to compete, the
ordinary reader, who has a distaste of new doctrines and innovating
theories, awards them the respect due to old established opinion.</p>

<p>That they should have been, with all their innovation on received
opinions, and their startling novelty, <!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_356" id="Page_v1_356">[356]</a></span>so popular in their own age, is
also a matter which has its peculiar explanation. The dread of
innovation, simply as change, and without reference to the interests it
may affect, sprung up in later times, a child of the French revolution.
Before that event some men were republican or constitutional in their
views, and declared war against all changes which tended to throw power
into the hands of the monarch. Others were monarchical, and opposed to
the extension of popular rights. But if an alteration were suggested
which did not affect these fundamental principles and opinions, it was
welcomed with liberal courtesy, examined, and adopted or rejected on its
own merits. Hence both Hume and Smith, writing in bold denunciation of
all the old cherished prejudices in matters of commerce, instead of
being met with a storm of reproach, as any one who should publish so
many original views in the present day would be, at once received a fair
hearing and a just appreciation.<a name="FNanchor_356:1_224" id="FNanchor_356:1_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_356:1_224" class="fnanchor">[356:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_357" id="Page_v1_357">[357]</a></span>Thus there was a period during which innovations, however bold or
extensive, received a favourable hearing, and in which the literature
both of England and of France was daily giving publicity to new theories
embodying sweeping alterations of social systems. In this work the two
countries presented their national characteristics. The English writers
kept always in view the question how far there would be a vital
principle remaining in society after the diseased part was removed; how
far there was reason to suppose that the small quantity of good done to
the public by any irrational system, which at the same time did much
evil, might be accomplished after its abolition. The French were
indiscriminate in their war against old received opinions, and offered
nothing to fill their place when they were gone; and hence in some
measure followed results which have made change and innovation words of
dread throughout a great part of society.</p>

<p>Of the inquiries through which Hume brought together the materials for
these essays, the reader will have found a specimen in the notes, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adversaria</i> quoted above.<a name="FNanchor_357:1_225" id="FNanchor_357:1_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:1_225" class="fnanchor">[357:1]</a> A comparison of these fragments of the
raw material, with the finished result, develops this marked feature in
Hume's method of working, that in the way to a short proposition, he has
often read and thought at great length. The simplicity and unity of his
writings were of more importance to him than the appearance of
elaboration; and where others would be scattering multitudinous
statements and authorities, he is content with the simple embodiment of
results, conscious that inquiry will confirm in the reader's mind the
justness of what he lays down. In some respects we can watch the
progress of <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_358" id="Page_v1_358">[358]</a></span>Hume's mind in connexion with these subjects; for in his
allusions to commercial matters in his earlier works, he uses the common
phraseology, such as "balance of trade," in a manner indicating an
adherence to those ordinary fallacies of the day, which, when he came to
examine them in his essays on "commerce," "money," "interest," "the
balance of trade," "taxes," and "public credit," he extensively
repudiated. His examination of the nature and value of money as a medium
of exchange, is probably the best and simplest that, even down to this
day, can be found. His theory, so far as it goes, has hardly ever been
questioned; and indeed at present it may be said, that beyond it we know
little with certainty, and that its author had at once discovered the
limits at which full and satisfactory knowledge was, for nearly a
century, to rest.<a name="FNanchor_358:1_226" id="FNanchor_358:1_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_358:1_226" class="fnanchor">[358:1]</a> He shows that <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_359" id="Page_v1_359">[359]</a></span>money is not in itself property
or value; that it is a mere representative, which, if cheap or dear in
<!-- Page 360 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_360" id="Page_v1_360"><br />[360]</a></span>its material, is just, in the same ratio, a cheap or a dear method of
accomplishing a purpose. That if a community could conduct its
transactions with a small quantity of money as well as with a large, it
would, so far from being poorer, be the richer by so much as the
superabundant money had cost. He examines those simple laws which, when
there is no disturbing influence, have a tendency to equalize the
distribution of the precious metals, through the cheapness of labour and
commodities where they are scarce, the nominal enhancement where they
are abundant. He notices with great clearness and precision the
respective effects upon the community of a state of increase, and of a
state of diminution of the available currency of a country. But he
enters on few of those intricate monetary questions which are now so
frequently the subject of discussion. Of inquiries into the causes which
affect the quantity of money in a country, the moving influences from
which arise <!-- Page 361 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_361" id="Page_v1_361">[361]</a></span>gluts, drains, stagnations, and all the mysteries of
finance, he shows us that he felt diffident; and on these matters, how
little is the quantity of full satisfactory undisputed knowledge which
we yet possess!</p>

<p>Indeed, one of the great merits of Hume's Essays on Political Economy
is, that he knows when he is getting out of his depth, and does not
conceal his position. With many writers on this subject, the point where
clear and satisfactory inquiry ends, is that where dogmatism begins; but
Hume stops at that point, sees and admits the difficulty, and
acknowledges that he can go no farther with safety.</p>

<p>Among these essays there is one which, like the Oceana of Harrington,
though on a smaller scale, is an attempt to construct a system of
polity. It is called "Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth." The system so put
together is liable to practical objections at every step, and is utterly
destitute of that sagacious applicability to the transactions of real
business, for which the efforts in hypothetical legislation by Bentham
are distinguished.<a name="FNanchor_361:1_227" id="FNanchor_361:1_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_361:1_227" class="fnanchor">[361:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_362" id="Page_v1_362">[362]</a></span>Another essay of a different character is conspicuous for the vast
extent of the learning and research <!-- Page 363 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_363" id="Page_v1_363"><br />[363]</a></span>which must have been expended in
bringing together its crowd of apt illustrations,&mdash;that on "The
Populousness of Ancient Nations." To afford a choice of so many
applicable facts, directly bearing on the point, how wide must have been
the research, how extensive the rejection of such fruit of that
research, as did not answer his purpose! In the perusal of this essay
one is inclined to regret that Hume afterwards made a portion of modern
Europe the object of his historical labours, instead of taking up some
department of the history of classical antiquity. The full blown lustre
of Greek and Roman greatness had far more of his sympathy than the
history of his own countrymen, and their slow progress from barbarism to
civilisation. The materials were nearly all confined to the great
spirits of antiquity, with whom he delighted to hold converse, instead
of involving that heap of documentary matter with which the historian of
Britain must grapple; acts of parliament, journals, writs, legal
documents, &amp;c.&mdash;all things which his soul abhorred. In such a field he
might have escaped the imputation of not being a full and fair
investigator; and he would, at all events, have avoided the reproach
thrown on him by the prying antiquary, who, by the light of newly
discovered documents, could charge him with having <!-- Page 364 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_364" id="Page_v1_364">[364]</a></span>neglected that of
which he did not, and could not, know the existence.<a name="FNanchor_364:1_228" id="FNanchor_364:1_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_364:1_228" class="fnanchor">[364:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_365" id="Page_v1_365">[365]</a></span>In a letter to Henry Home in 1748, we find Hume mentioning an essay on
the Protestant Succession, as one which he was to include in the edition
of his "Essays Moral and Political," then preparing for the
press.<a name="FNanchor_365:1_229" id="FNanchor_365:1_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:1_229" class="fnanchor">[365:1]</a> He speaks of people having endeavoured to divert him from
this publication, as one likely to be injurious to him as an official
man. Perhaps he was prevailed on to adopt the view of his prudent
friends, for this essay is not among the "Essays Moral and Political,"
but forms one of the volume of Discourses, among which it is somewhat
inharmoniously placed, as it is the only one which bears a reference to
the current internal party politics of the day.</p>

<p>The "Political Discourses" introduced Hume to the literature of the
continent. The works of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quesnay, Rivière, Mirabeau, Raynal</span>, and Turgot,
had not yet appeared, but the public mind of France had been opened for
novel doctrines by the bold appeal of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vauban</span>,<a name="FNanchor_365:2_230" id="FNanchor_365:2_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:2_230" class="fnanchor">[365:2]</a> and by the curious

been first translated by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eléazer Mauvillon</span>, a native of Provence, and

some time in England, and wrote a work on his experiences in Britain,
called "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres sur les Anglois</span>." He was the author also of a tragedy
called Aben Säid, which seems to have now lost any fame it ever
acquired. His translations from Hume were, however, highly popular, that
of the Discourses passing through several editions; and we shall find
that they obtained the approbation of Hume himself. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span>, in a
letter to the author, gives an account of the reception of the

enriched, as regarding a matter in which he felt himself to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars

caused by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit des Loix</span>, and he finds his prophecy fulfilled. He
states, that it is not only read with avidity, but that it has given
rise to a multitude of other works. There can be no doubt, indeed, that
as no Frenchman had previously approached the subject of political
economy with a philosophical pen, this little book was a main
instrument, either by causing assent or provoking controversy, in
producing the host of French works on political economy, published
between the time of its translation, and the publication of Smith's
"Wealth of Nations," in 1776.<a name="FNanchor_366:2_234" id="FNanchor_366:2_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_366:2_234" class="fnanchor">[366:2]</a> <!-- Page 367 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_367" id="Page_v1_367">[367]</a></span>The work of the elder <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mirabeau</span> in

and skilful defence of William Veitch, one of the nonconforming clergy,
who suffered in the persecutions of the reign of Charles II. Elliot
acting as the persecuted man's agent, made an appeal to the feelings of
the English statesmen, on the barbarity of the measures of their Scots
colleagues; and was so far successful, that the sentence of death
pronounced against Veitch, was commuted to banishment. He thenceforth
became, of course, a marked man, and an act of forfeiture passed against
him in 1685, as an accessory in Argyle's rising. He afterwards obtained
a remission of his sentence, and on 22d November, 1688, he was received
as a member of the faculty of advocates. He was created a baronet in
1700, and on 25th July, 1705, was raised to the bench. (<cite>Brunton and
Haig's account of the Senators of the College of Justice.</cite>) In Dr.
M'Crie's curious "Memoirs of Mr. William Veitch," (p. 99) it is stated,
that when the evil days were passed, and the condemned nonconformist was
parish minister of Dumfries, he was occasionally visited by the judge,
when the following conversation passed between them,&mdash;"Ah Willie,
Willie, had it no' been for me, the pyets had been pyken your pate on

Edinburgh, who was revered as a minister, and respected as a scholar and
philosopher, published in 1830, "Dialogues on Natural and Revealed
Religion," a pleasing continuation of the work we have just been
considering, in which the speakers are made to approach a conclusion
nearer to the reverend author's own opinions, than he found them to be
when he had read to the end of Hume's little book. From a note by Dr.
Morehead, I am tempted to extract the following passage: "Mr. Hume was
conscious of his own power, probably while his countrymen were making
him a theme of their uncouth derision; and he seems to have had a
prescience that he had not yet gathered all his fame.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am much
mistaken if the name of this profound thinker does not yet receive the
encomiastic epithets of a <em>grateful</em> posterity; and if, when his errors
have passed away, he does not yet come to be regarded as the philosopher
who has made the most penetrating and successful researches in the
intricate science of human nature. He is a cool anatomist, who has
dissected it throughout every fibre and nerve; and he may be partly
pardoned, perhaps, if, in this sort of remorseless operation, he has too
much lost sight of the principle of its moral and intellectual life."
The Dialogues on Natural Religion seem to have taken a firm hold of Dr.
Morehead's mind. He left behind him a farther continuation, called
"Philosophical Dialogues," in which he beautifully represented the Philo
of the original, revising his old opinions amidst such a serene old age,
as the writer was then himself enjoying. This little work was published
after its author's death, by a distinguished surviving friend, who has
probably done more towards the propagation of Christian philosophy, than
any other living writer of the English language.</p>

temptation to print it along with Hume's letter, was only overcome by
the circumstance that it is to be found in a work widely circulated, and

Morality, with Reflections upon Mr. Hume's book, entitled an 'Inquiry
concerning the Principles of Morals.'"</p>

<p>On the publication of this book, Hume wrote the following letter,
addressed "To the Author of the Delineation of the Nature and
Obligations of Morality," and left it with the bookseller.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;When I write you, I know not to whom I am addressing myself: I
only know he is one who has done me a great deal of honour, and to whose
civilities I am obliged. If we be strangers, I beg we may be acquainted,
as soon as you think proper to discover yourself: if we be acquainted
already, I beg we may be friends: if friends, I beg we may be more so.
Our connexion with each other as men of letters, is greater than our
difference as adhering to different sects or systems. Let us revive the
happy times, when Atticus and Cassius the epicureans, Cicero the
academic, and Brutus the stoic, could all of them live in unreserved
friendship together, and were insensible to all those distinctions,
except so far as they furnished agreeable matter to discourse and
conversation. Perhaps you are a young man, and being full of those
sublime ideas, which you have so well expressed, think there can be no
virtue upon a more confined system. I am not an old one; but, being of a
cool temperament, have always found, that more simple views were
sufficient to make me act in a reasonable manner; <ins class="greek" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="nêthe, kai memnêso apistein">νηθε,
και μἑμνησο ἀπιστειν</ins>; in this faith have I lived, and hope to die.</p>

<p>"Your civilities to me so much overbalance your severities, that I
should be ungrateful to take notice of some expressions which, in the
heat of composition, have dropped from your pen. I must only complain of
you a little for ascribing to me the sentiments, which I have put into
the mouth of the Sceptic in the "Dialogue." I have surely endeavoured to
refute the sceptic, with all the force of which I am master; and my
refutation must be allowed sincere, because drawn from the capital
principles of my system. But you impute to me both the sentiments of the
sceptic, and the sentiments of his antagonist, which I can never admit
of. In every dialogue no more than one person can be supposed to
represent the author.</p>

<p>"Your severity on one head, that of chastity, is so great, and I am so
little conscious of having given any just occasion to it, that it has
afforded me a hint to form a conjecture, perhaps ill-grounded,
concerning your person.</p>

<p>"I hope to steal a little leisure from my other occupations, in order to
defend my philosophy against your attacks. If I have occasion to give a
new edition of the work, which you have honoured with an answer, I shall
make great advantage of your remarks, and hope to obviate some of your
criticisms.</p>

<p>"Your style is elegant, and full of agreeable imagery. In some few
places it does not fully come up to my ideas of purity and correctness.
I suppose mine falls still further short of your ideas. In this respect,
we may certainly be of use to each other. With regard to our
philosophical systems, I suppose we are both so fixed, that there is no
hope of any conversions betwixt us; and for my part, I doubt not but we
shall both do as well to remain as we are.</p>

satisfy his own mind. In the "Outlines of Philosophical Education," by
Professor Jardine, who afterwards filled the same chair, there is this
passage, (p. 21:) "Burke, whose genius led him afterwards to shine in a
more exalted sphere, was thought of by some of the electors as a proper

speculation to conjecture what effect the appointment of Mr. Hume, or of
Mr. Burke, to the chair of logic in Glasgow, would have had upon the
character of that university, or upon the metaphysical, moral, and
political inquiries of the age in which they lived; and what
consequences were likely to have resulted from the influence which the
peculiar genius and talents of either of these great men, had they been
exerted in that sphere, must necessarily have had in forming the minds
of such of their pupils as were to be afterwards employed in the
pursuits of science, or the conduct and regulation of human affairs. It
seems difficult to conceive how, as instructors of youth, they could
either of them, without a considerable modification of their opinions,
have taught philosophy upon the sceptical or the Berkeleian systems
which they had respectively adopted; while the strict purity of their
moral characters, and the great reverence which they both entertained
for established institutions, give the fullest assurance, that, had
either of them been appointed to the chair of logic, their academical
duties would have been executed with an unceasing regard to the
improvement of their pupils, and to the reputation of the society into
which they had been admitted." Life of Cullen, p. 73.</p>

<p>Smith, in a letter to Dr. Cullen, says, "I should prefer David Hume to
any man for a colleague; but I am afraid the public would not be of my
opinion; and the interest of the society will oblige us to have some
regard to the opinion of the public. If the event, however, we are
afraid of should happen, we can see how the public receives it. From the
particular knowledge I have of Mr. Elliot's sentiments, I am pretty
certain Mr. Lindsay must have proposed it to him, not he to Mr.
Lindsay." Ib. p. 606.</p>

would be difficult to speak in terms of too great commendation. They
combine almost every excellence which can belong to such a performance.
The reasoning is clear, and unencumbered with more words or more
illustrations than are necessary for bringing out the doctrine. The
learning is extensive, accurate, and profound, not only as to systems of
philosophy, but as to history, whether modern or ancient. The subjects
are most happily chosen; the language is elegant, precise, and vigorous;
and so admirably are the topics selected, that there is as little of
dryness in these fine essays as if the subject were not scientific; and
we rise from their perusal scarce able to believe that it is a work of
philosophy we have been reading, having all the while thought it a book
of curiosity and entertainment. The great merit, however, of these
Discourses, is their originality, and the new system of politics and
political economy which they unfold. Mr. Hume is, beyond all doubt, the
author of the modern doctrines which now rule the world of science,
which are to a great extent the guide of practical statesmen, and are
only prevented from being applied in their fullest extent to the affairs
of nations, by the clashing interests and the ignorant prejudices of
certain powerful classes." Lives of Men of Letters, p. 204.</p>

essays are read by those who are not partial to the study of political
economy, may be attributed to their having been written before that
science was in possession of a nomenclature, and thus appearing clothed
in the ordinary language of literature.</p>

innovating doctrines were best received; for in them was the greatest
amount of education, and its influence was not at that time paralyzed by
general prejudices against innovation. They were more in favour with the
Tories than with the Whigs. Indeed, Archdeacon Tucker, one of the
boldest speculators on the economy of trade, was in state politics one
of the most uncompromising Tories of his age. Fox, on the other hand,
said of the "Wealth of Nations," that "there was something in all these
subjects which passed his comprehension, something so wide that he could
never embrace them himself, or find any one who did." But in the French
treaty, and in other measures regarding trade, Pitt was in the fair way
of putting them into legislative practice, when, being arrested by the
French revolution, he entertained thenceforward a bitter enmity of
innovation; an enmity to which, in the department of political economy,
his party became the heirs, preserving the succession down nearly to the
present day, when, at least by their leader, old prejudices have been
already in a great measure, and are likely soon to be altogether
repudiated.</p>

Political Economy is immaculate, but merely that in the majority of
instances he has fixed certain truths which later inquiries have not
shaken. The following passage, along with much that is received as true
doctrine, contains some observations, such as those on the tax on German
linen, and on brandy, which modern economists would pronounce to be
heterodox. The question of a gold or a paper currency was one which Hume
did not profess to decide. He described with considerable impartiality
the advantages and the disadvantages of both mediums of exchange.</p>

<p>"From these principles we may learn what judgment we ought to form of
those numberless bars, obstructions, and imposts, which all nations of
Europe, and none more than England, have put upon trade, from an
exorbitant desire of amassing money, which never will heap up beyond its
level, while it circulates; or from an ill-grounded apprehension of
losing their specie, which never will sink below it. Could any thing
scatter our riches, it would be such impolitic contrivances. But this
general ill effect, however, results from them, that they deprive
neighbouring nations of that free communication and exchange which the
Author of the world has intended, by giving them soils, climates, and
geniuses, so different from each other.</p>

<p>"Our modern politics embrace the only method of banishing money, the
using of paper credit; they reject the only method of amassing it, the
practice of hoarding; and they adopt a hundred contrivances, which serve
to no purpose but to check industry, and rob ourselves and our
neighbours of the common benefits of art and nature.</p>

<p>"All taxes, however, upon foreign commodities, are not to be regarded as
prejudicial or useless, but those only which are founded on the jealousy
above mentioned. A tax on German linen encourages home manufactures, and
thereby multiplies our people and industry. A tax on brandy increases
the sale of rum, and supports our southern colonies. And as it is
necessary that imposts should be levied for the support of government,
it may be thought more convenient to lay them on foreign commodities,
which can easily be intercepted at the port, and subjected to the
impost. We ought, however, always to remember the maxim of Dr. Swift,
that, in the arithmetic of the customs, two and two make not four, but
often make only one. It can scarcely be doubted, but if the duties on
wine were lowered to a third, they would yield much more to the
government than at present: our people might thereby afford to drink
commonly a better and more wholesome liquor; and no prejudice would
ensue to the balance of trade, of which we are so jealous. The
manufacture of ale beyond the agriculture is but inconsiderable, and
gives employment to few hands. The transport of wine and corn would not
be much inferior."</p>

<p>The following account of a banking practice still in lively operation in
Scotland, affords a specimen of Hume's capacity to grapple with
practical details.</p>

<p>"There was an invention which was fallen upon some years ago by the
banks of Edinburgh, and which, as it was one of the most ingenious ideas
that has been executed in commerce, has also been thought advantageous
to Scotland. It is there called a Bank-Credit, and is of this nature:&mdash;A
man goes to the bank, and finds surety to the amount, we shall suppose,
of a thousand pounds. This money, or any part of it, he has the liberty
of drawing out whenever he pleases, and he pays only the ordinary
interest for it while it is in his hands. He may, when he pleases, repay
any sum so small as twenty pounds, and the interest is discounted from
the very day of the repayment. The advantages resulting from this
contrivance are manifold. As a man may find surety nearly to the amount
of his substance, and his bank-credit is equivalent to ready money, a
merchant does hereby in a manner coin his houses, his household
furniture, the goods in his warehouse, the foreign debts due to him, his
ships at sea; and can, upon occasion, employ them in all payments, as if
they were the current money of the country. If a man borrow a thousand
pounds from a private hand, besides that it is not always to be found
when required, he pays interest for it whether he be using it or not:
his bank-credit costs him nothing except during the very moment in which
it is of service to him: and this circumstance is of equal advantage as
if he had borrowed money at much lower interest. Merchants likewise,
from this invention, acquire a great facility in supporting each other's
credit, which is a considerable security against bankruptcies. A man,
when his own bank-credit is exhausted, goes to any of his neighbours who
is not in the same condition, and he gets the money, which he replaces
at his convenience."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_361:1_227" id="Footnote_361:1_227"></a><a href="#FNanchor_361:1_227"><span class="label">[361:1]</span></a> Indeed, in all respects, Hume's political economy is
rather analytical of the effect of existing institutions and
establishments, than suggestive of any views on the practicability of
any great amelioration of mankind by positive regulations founded on
principles of political economy. Adam Smith pursued the same method. The
mission of that school was indeed rather to break down than to build
up&mdash;to find out and eradicate the mischief that had been done by empiric
legislation; not to attempt new arrangements. While so much mischievous
matter remained to be got rid of, the field was not clear for any
attempts to try the effect of plans of social organization. It is
perhaps only now when the doctrines of the political economists, after
having stood out against neglect and hostility, have been nearly brought
into practice by the successive abolition of the regulations most
objectionable in their eyes, that room has been made for the suggestion
of plans of internal social organization, founded on inquiries both
extensive and minute. In the present position of measures for the
physical and moral purification, and the social organization of this
densely peopled empire,&mdash;in the approach to an adjustment of the poor
law,&mdash;the reform of the criminal code,&mdash;the prison discipline, and the
sanatory suggestions; and still more, in these not being the mere dreams
of utopian theorists, but receiving the countenance and support of
practical statesmen, we appear to have witnessed the dawn of a new era
in political economy.</p>

<p>Hume seems so far from having himself contemplated the application of
philosophical skill to the organization of large masses of human beings,
that we frequently find in his writings and in his letters, remarks on
the growth of cities, sometimes speaking of certain limits which they
cannot pass, at other times noticing, in a tone of despondency, the
rapid progress of London, as if it were exceeding those bounds within
which mankind can be kept under the dominion of law and order. In the
essay on the Populousness of Ancient Nations, he says, "London, by
uniting extensive commerce and middling empire, has perhaps arrived at a
greatness, which no city will perhaps be able to exceed;" and he fixes
this number at 700,000 inhabitants,&mdash;saying farther, "from the
experience of past and present ages, one might conjecture that there is
a kind of impossibility that any city could ever rise much beyond this
proportion." London must then have been considerably under the
population he thus assigns to it, and it had not probably reached that
number of inhabitants twenty-four years later, when we find him,
oppressed by the disease of which he died, saying in a letter to Smith,
"should London fall as much in its size as I have done, it will be the
better. It is nothing but a hulk of bad and unclean humours."</p>

<p>During Hume's lifetime, the metropolis had been frequently outraged and
intimidated&mdash;on some occasions almost desolated, by mobs of city
savages; beings far more formidable and brutal than the savages of the
wilderness. At the time when he published his Political Discourses, it
contained bands of robbers, who followed their trade as openly as the
brigands of the Abruzzi, committing robberies and murders in the middle
of the city, in open day. Those who saw the city increasing in size,
while it retained these evil characteristics, naturally looked upon it
as a cancer, near the most vital part of the empire, and lamented
accordingly its waxing prosperity and bulk. But its size was not the
cause of the evil. It is now three times as populous as when Hume wrote,
yet, with much poverty, much vice, and much ignorance, it is not the
same diseased and dangerous mass it then was. The comparative sober
quietness of the streets,&mdash;the well ordered police,&mdash;the facilities for
discovering persons who are sought after, without their being subjected
in their movements to any control, inconsistent with British
liberty,&mdash;are all, when practised on so large a scale, indications that
human genius has great capacities for organization; and they may be, for
aught that can be seen to the contrary, only the initial movements,
which future generations will carry to far more wonderful results.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_364:1_228" id="Footnote_364:1_228"></a><a href="#FNanchor_364:1_228"><span class="label">[364:1]</span></a> Dr. Robert Wallace, a distinguished clergyman of the
Church of Scotland, had prepared for the Philosophical Society, of which
he was a member, an essay, which he enlarged and published in 1752, with
the title, "Dissertations on the Numbers of Mankind in Ancient and
Modern Times;" adding a supplement, in which he examined Hume's
discourse on the Populousness of Ancient Nations. Malthus admitted that
Dr. Wallace was the first to point distinctly to the rule, that to find
the limits of the populousness of any given community, we must look at
the quantity of food at its disposal. But he was not successful in the
controversial application of his principle. Hume's method of inquiry is
a double comparison. The statements of numbers in ancient authors being
compared with the numbers in existing communities, the relative
organization for the supply of food in the two cases is examined, and
the author finds reason to believe that the statements of numbers are
greatly exaggerated by ancient authors, as the state of commerce and
transit, and the amount of stock or capital available for the
concentration and distribution of food, are not such as would enable
such multitudes to be supported. Dr. Wallace, laying down, that where
there is the most food there will be the greatest number of inhabitants,
maintains, that as a much greater proportion of the people were employed
in agriculture among the ancients than the moderns, there must have been
more food and consequently more human beings. It is almost needless,
after so much has been written on this matter, to explain at length the
fallacy of this reasoning. The richest and most populous states are
those of which the smallest proportion of the people are employed in
agriculture. A decrease of the comparative number employed in procuring
the necessaries of life is the mark of increase in wealth and abundance
of all things, and is necessarily accompanied either by a proportionally
improved agriculture, or the purchase of food from poorer communities.</p>

<p>In the subsequent editions of the "Discourses," Hume acknowledges the
merit of Wallace's book, saying, "So learned a refutation would have
made the author suspect that his reasonings were entirely overthrown,
had he not used the precaution, from the beginning, to keep himself on
the sceptical side; and, having taken this advantage of the ground, he
was enabled, though with much inferior forces, to preserve himself from
a total defeat."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="centersc"><!-- Page 369 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_369" id="Page_v1_369">[369]</a></span>Hume to Dr. Clephane.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, February 4th, 1752.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I have been ready to burst with vanity and
self-conceit this week past; and being obliged from decorum to
keep a strict watch over myself, and check all eruptions of
that kind, I really begin to find my health impaired by it,
and perceive that there is an absolute necessity for breathing
a vein, and giving a loose to my inclination. You shall
therefore be my physician, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dum podagricus fit pugil et
medicum urget</span>." You must sustain the overflowings of my pride;
and I expect, too, that by a little flattery you are to help
nature in her discharge, and draw forth a still greater flux
of the peccant matter. 'Tis not on my account alone you are to
take part in this great event; philosophy, letters, science,
virtue, triumph along with me, and have now in this one
singular instance, brought over even the people from the side
of bigotry and superstition.</p>

<p><!-- Page 370 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_370" id="Page_v1_370">[370]</a></span>"This is a very pompous exordium, you see; but what will you
say when I tell you that all this is occasioned by my
obtaining a petty office of forty or fifty guineas a-year.
Since Caligula of lunatic memory, who triumphed on account of
the cockle shells which he gathered on the sea shore, no one
has ever erected a trophy for so small an advantage. But judge
not by appearances! perhaps you will think, when you know all
the circumstances, that this success is both as extraordinary
in itself, and as advantageous to me, as any thing which could
possibly have happened.</p>

<p>"You have probably heard that my friends in Glasgow, contrary
to my opinion and advice, undertook to get me elected into
that college; and they had succeeded, in spite of the violent
and solemn remonstrances of the clergy, if the Duke of Argyle
had had courage to give me the least countenance. Immediately
upon the back of this failure, which should have blasted for
some time all my pretensions, the office of library keeper to
the Faculty of Advocates fell vacant, a genteel office, though
of small revenue; and as this happened suddenly, my name was
immediately set up by my friends without my knowledge. The
President, and the Dean of Faculty his son, who used to rule
absolutely in this body of advocates, formed an aversion to
the project, because it had not come from them; and they
secretly engaged the whole party called squadroney against me.
The bigots joined them, and both together set up a gentleman
of character, and an advocate, and who had great favour on
both these accounts. The violent cry of deism, atheism, and
scepticism, was raised against me; and 'twas represented that
my election would be giving the sanction of the greatest and
most learned body of <!-- Page 371 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_371" id="Page_v1_371">[371]</a></span>men in this country to my profane and
irreligious principles. But what was more dangerous, my
opponents entered into a regular concert and cabal against me;
while my friends were contented to speak well of their project
in general, without having once formed a regular list of the
electors, or considered of the proper methods of engaging
them. Things went on in this negligent manner till within six
days of the election, when they met together and found
themselves in some danger of being outnumbered; immediately
upon which they raised the cry of indignation against the
opposite party; and the public joined them so heartily, that
our antagonists durst show their heads in no companies nor
assemblies: expresses were despatched to the country,
assistance flocked to us from all quarters, and I carried the
election by a considerable majority, to the great joy of all
bystanders. When faction and party enter into a cause, the
smallest trifle becomes important. Nothing since the rebellion
has ever so much engaged the attention of this town, except
Provost Stewart's trial; and there scarce is a man whose
friendship or acquaintance I would desire, who has not given
me undoubted proofs of his concern and regard.</p>

<p>"What is more extraordinary, the cry of religion could not
hinder the ladies from being violently my partisans, and I owe
my success in a great measure to their solicitations. One has
broke off all commerce with her lover, because he voted
against me! and W. Lockhart, in a speech to the Faculty, said
that there was no walking the streets, nor even enjoying one's
own fireside, on account of their importunate zeal. The town
says, that even his bed was not safe for him, though his wife
was cousin-german to my antagonist.</p>

<p>"'Twas vulgarly given out, that the contest was <!-- Page 372 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_372" id="Page_v1_372">[372]</a></span>betwixt
Deists and Christians; and when the news of my success came to
the Play-house, the whisper ran that the Christians were
defeated. Are you not surprised that we could keep our
popularity, notwithstanding this imputation, which my friends
could not deny to be well founded?</p>

<p>"The whole body of cadies bought flambeux, and made
illuminations to mark their pleasure at my success; and next
morning I had the drums and town music at my door, to express
their joy, as they said, of my being made a great man. They
could not imagine, that so great a fray could be raised about
so mere a trifle.</p>

<p>"About a fortnight before, I had published a Discourse of the
Protestant Succession, wherein I had very liberally abused
both Whigs and Tories; yet I enjoyed the favour of both
parties.</p>

<p>"Such, dear Doctor, is the triumph of your friend; yet, amidst
all this greatness and glory, even though master of 30,000
volumes, and possessing the smiles of a hundred fair ones, in
this very pinnacle of human grandeur and felicity, I cast a
favourable regard on you, and earnestly desire your friendship
and good-will: a little flattery too, from so eminent a hand,
would be very acceptable to me. You know you are somewhat in
my debt, in that particular. The present I made you of my
Inquiry, was calculated both as a mark of my regard, and as a
snare to catch a little incense from you. Why do you put me to
the necessity of giving it to myself?</p>

<p>"Please tell General St. Clair, that W. St. Clair, the
Advocate, voted for me on his account; but his nephew, Sir
David, was so excessively holy, that nothing could bring him
over from the opposite party, for which he is looked down upon
a little by <!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_373" id="Page_v1_373">[373]</a></span>the fashionable company in town. But he is a very
pretty fellow, and will soon regain the little ground he has
lost.</p>

<p>"I am, dear Doctor, yours sincerely."</p>
</div>

<p>This letter is evidently but half serious. That there was a good deal of
contest and caballing is pretty clear; and it is equally clear that Hume
took a deep interest in the result: but he appears to have been inclined
to laugh a little at his own fervour, and to hide the full extent of his
feelings under a cloud of playful exaggeration.</p>

<p>The Advocates' Library, which is now probably next in extent in Britain
after the Bodleian, cannot then have borne any great proportion to its
present size. It had, however, existed for upwards of seventy years, and
was undoubtedly the largest collection of books in Scotland. It was
rich, perhaps unrivalled, in the works of the civilians and canonists,
and possessed, what was more valuable to Hume, a considerable body of
British historical literature, printed and MS.<a name="FNanchor_373:1_236" id="FNanchor_373:1_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_373:1_236" class="fnanchor">[373:1]</a> Hume's duties must
have involved some attention, not only to the classification and custody
of the books, but to the arrangements for making them accessible to the
members of the Faculty, as numerous entries in his hand are to be found
in the receipt book for borrowed books.<a name="FNanchor_373:2_237" id="FNanchor_373:2_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_373:2_237" class="fnanchor">[373:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 374 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_374" id="Page_v1_374">[374]</a></span>Hume informs us, that the stores thus put at his command enabled him to
put his historical designs in practice, by commencing the "History of
England." We shall now find a great part of his correspondence devoted
to the "History of the House of Stuart," which appears to have been
commenced early in 1752. The following is the earliest extant letter to
Smith:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_375" id="Page_v1_375">[375]</a></span><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"24th Sept. 1752.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I confess I was once of the same opinion with you,
and thought that the best period to begin an English history
was about Henry the Seventh. But you will please to observe,
that the change which then happened in public affairs, was
very insensible, and did not display its influence till many
years afterwards. 'Twas under James that the House of Commons
began first to raise their head, and then the quarrel betwixt
privilege and prerogative commenced. The government, no longer
oppressed by the enormous authority of the crown, displayed
its genius; and the factions which then arose, having an
influence on our present affairs, form the most curious,
interesting, and instructive part of our history. The
preceding events, or causes, may easily be shown, in a
reflection or review, which may be artfully inserted in the
body of the work; and the whole, by that means, be rendered
more compact and uniform. I confess, that the subject appears
to me very fine; and I enter upon it with great ardour and
pleasure. You need not doubt of my perseverance.</p>

<p>"I am just now diverted for a moment, by correcting my 'Essays
Moral and Political,' for a new edition. If any thing occur to
you to be inserted or retrenched, I shall be obliged to you
for the hint. In case you should not have the last edition by
you, I shall send you a copy of it. In that edition I was
engaged to act contrary to my judgment, in retaining the sixth
and seventh Essays,<a name="FNanchor_375:1_238" id="FNanchor_375:1_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_375:1_238" class="fnanchor">[375:1]</a> which I had resolved to throw out,
as too frivolous for the rest, and not very agreeable neither,
even in that trifling manner: but Millar, <!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_376" id="Page_v1_376">[376]</a></span>my bookseller, made
such protestations against it, and told me how much he had
heard them praised by the best judges, that the bowels of a
parent melted, and I preserved them alive.</p>

<p>"All the rest of Bolingbroke's works went to the press last
week, as Millar informs me. I confess my curiosity is not much
raised.</p>

<p>"I had almost lost your letter by its being wrong directed. I
received it late, which was the reason why you got not sooner
a copy of Joannes Magnus. Direct to me in Riddal's Land,
Lawnmarket. I am, dear Sir, yours sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_376:1_239" id="FNanchor_376:1_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_376:1_239" class="fnanchor">[376:1]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">1753.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I need not inform you, that in certain polite
countries, a custom prevails, of writing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettres de la
nouvelle année</i>, and that many advantages result from this
practice, which may seem merely ceremonious and formal.
Acquaintance is thereby kept up, friendship revived, quarrels
extinguished, negligence atoned for, and correspondences
renewed. A man who has been so long conscious of his sins,
that he knows not how to return into the way of salvation,
taking advantage of this great jubilee, wipes off all past
offences, and obtains plenary indulgence; instances are not
wanting of such reclaimed sinners, who have afterwards proved
the greatest saints, and have even heaped up many works of
supererogation. Will you allow me, therefore, dear Doctor, in
consideration of my present penitence, and hopes of my future
amendment, to address myself to you, and to wish you many and
happy new years, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">multos et felices</i>. <!-- Page 377 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_377" id="Page_v1_377">[377]</a></span>May pleasures spiritual
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spirituels</i>) multiply upon you without a decay of the
carnal. May riches increase without an augmentation of
desires. May your chariot still roll along without a failure
of your limbs. May your tongue in due time acquire the <em>social
sweet garrulity</em> of age, without your teeth losing the
sharpness and keenness of youth. May &mdash;&mdash; but you yourself will
best supply the last prayer, whether it should be for the
recovery or continuance of the blessing which I hint at. In
either case, may your prayer be granted, even though it should
extend to the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p>"I must now set you an example, and speak of myself. By this I
mean that you are to speak to me of yourself. I shall exult
and triumph to you a little, that I have now at last&mdash;being
turned of forty, to my own honour, to that of learning, and to
that of the present age&mdash;arrived at the dignity of being a
householder. About seven months ago, I got a house of my own,
and completed a regular family; consisting of a head, viz.
myself, and two inferior members, a maid and a cat. My sister
has since joined me, and keeps me company. With frugality I
can reach, I find, cleanliness, warmth, light, plenty, and
contentment. What would you have more? Independence? I have it
in a supreme degree. Honour? that is not altogether wanting.
Grace? that will come in time. A wife? that is none of the
indispensable requisites of life. Books? that <em>is</em> one of
them; and I have more than I can use. In short, I cannot find
any blessing of consequence which I am not possessed of, in a
greater or less degree; and without any great effort of
philosophy, I may be easy and satisfied.</p>

<p>"As there is no happiness without occupation, I <!-- Page 378 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_378" id="Page_v1_378">[378]</a></span>have begun a
work which will employ me several years, and which yields me
much satisfaction. 'Tis a History of Britain, from the Union
of the Crowns to the present time. I have already finished the
reign of King James. My friends flatter me (by this I mean
that they don't flatter me) that I have succeeded. You know
that there is no post of honour in the English Parnassus more
vacant than that of history. Style, judgment, impartiality,
care&mdash;every thing is wanting to our historians; and even
Rapin, during this latter period, is extremely deficient. I
make my work very concise, after the manner of the ancients.
It divides into three very moderate volumes: one to end with
the death of Charles the First; the second at the Revolution;
the third at the Accession,<a name="FNanchor_378:1_240" id="FNanchor_378:1_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_378:1_240" class="fnanchor">[378:1]</a> for I dare come no nearer
the present times. The work will neither please the Duke of
Bedford nor James Fraser; but I hope it will please you and
posterity. <ins class="greek" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="Ktêma eis aei.">Κτῆμα εις ἀεὶ.</ins></p>

court intrigues, or civil wars, and bid you heartily adieu.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am to give you great and very hearty thanks for
your care in providing for my cousin, at my desire. The
quickness in doing it, and the many obliging circumstances
attending that good office, I shall not readily forget. What
is usual, they say, makes little impression; but that this
rule admits of exceptions, I feel upon every instance of your
friendship.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mure told me that you had undertaken to get satisfaction
with regard to the old English <em>subsidies</em>. I cannot satisfy
myself on that head; but I find that all historians and
antiquarians are as much at a loss. The nobility, I observe,
paid according to their rank and quality, not their estates.
The counties were subjected to no valuation; but it was in the
power of the commissioners to sink the sums demanded upon
every individual, without raising it upon others; and they
practised this art when discontented with the court, as
Charles complains of with regard to the subsidies voted by his
third parliament: yet it seems certain that there must have
been some rule of estimation. What was it? Why was it so
variable? Lord Strafford raised an Irish subsidy from £12,000
to £40,000, by changing the rule of valuation; but the Irish
Parliament, after his impeachment, brought it down again: if
Mr. Harding undertakes the solution of this matter, it will be
requisite to have these difficulties in his eye. I am glad to
hear that we are to have your company here this summer, and
that I shall have an opportunity of talking over this, and
many other subjects, where I want your advice and opinion. The
more I advance in my work, the more I am convinced that the
history of England has never <!-- Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_381" id="Page_v1_381">[381]</a></span>yet been written; not only for
style, which is notorious to all the world, but also for
matter; such is the ignorance and partiality of all our
historians. Rapin, whom I had an esteem for, is totally
despicable. I may be liable to the reproach of ignorance, but
I am certain of escaping that of partiality: the truth is,
there is so much reason to blame, and praise, alternately,
king and parliament, that I am afraid the mixture of both, in
my composition, being so equal, may pass sometimes for an
affectation, and not the result of judgment and evidence. Of
this you shall be judge; for I am resolved to encroach on your
leisure and patience;</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the first volume of the "History of England" was
composed and printed, has been the object both of surprise and censure.
Hume's labours at this time must have been intense; and during the whole
of the period in which he was engaged in the different departments of
this great work&mdash;from 1752 to 1763&mdash;his correspondence is more scanty
than at other periods of his history. Four months elapse between the
letter last printed, and the next in order which has been preserved; and
in the latter, we find him very wittily alluding to those great labours
which he finds absorbing the petty duties of social intercourse.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"28th October, 1753.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I know not if you remember the <!-- Page 382 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_382" id="Page_v1_382">[382]</a></span>giant in
Rabelais, who swallowed every morning a windmill to breakfast,
and at last was choked upon a pound of melted butter, hot from
an oven. I am going to compare myself to that giant. I think
nothing of despatching a quarto in fifteen or eighteen months,
but am not able to compose a letter once in two years; and am
very industrious to keep up a correspondence with posterity,
whom I know nothing about, and who, probably, will concern
themselves very little about me, while I allow myself to be
forgot by my friends, whom I value and regard. However, it is
some satisfaction that I can give you an account of my
silence, with which I own I reproach myself. I have now
brought down my History to the death of Charles the First: and
here I intend to pause for some time; to read, and think, and
correct; to look forward and backward; and to adopt the most
moderate and most reasonable sentiments on all subjects. I am
sensible that the history of the two first Stuarts will be
most agreeable to the Tories; that of the two last to the
Whigs; but we must endeavour to be above any regard either to
Whigs or Tories.</p>

<p>"Having thus satisfied your curiosity&mdash;for I will take it for
granted that your curiosity extends towards me&mdash;I must now
gratify my own. I was very anxious to hear that you had been
molested with some disorders this summer. I was told that you
expected they would settle into a fit of the gout. It is lucky
where that distemper overtakes a man in his chariot: we
foot-walkers make but an awkward figure with it. I hope nobody
has the impertinence to say to you, Physician, cure thyself.
All the world allows that privilege to the gout, that it is
not to be cured: it is itself a physician; and, of course,
sometimes cures and sometimes kills. I fancy one fit of <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_383" id="Page_v1_383">[383]</a></span>the
gout would much increase your stock of interjections, and
render that part of speech, which in common grammars is
usually the most barren, with you more copious than either
nouns or verbs.</p>

<p>"I must tell you good news of our friend Sir Harry. I am
informed that his talent for eloquence will not rust for want
of employment: he bids fair for another seat of the house; and
what is the charming part of the story, it is General
Anstruther's seat which he is to obtain. He has made an attack
on the General's boroughs, and, by the assistance of his
uncle's interest and purse, is likely to prevail. Is not this
delicious revenge? It brings to my mind the story of the
Italian, who reading that passage of Scripture, 'Vengeance is
mine, saith the Lord,' burst forth, 'Ay, to be sure; it is too
sweet for any mortal.' I own I envy Sir Harry: I never can
hope to hate any body so perfectly as he does that renowned
commander; and no victory, triumph, vengeance, success, can be
more complete. Are not you pleased too? Pray, anatomize your
own mind, and tell me how many grains of your satisfaction is
owing to malice, and how many ounces to friendship. I leave
the rest of this paper to be filled up by Edmonstone. I am,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;After keeping this by me eight days, I have never been
able to meet with Edmonstone. I must, therefore, send off my
own part of a letter which we projected in common. I shall
only tell you, that I have since seen Mr. Oswald, who assures
me that Anstruther's defeat is infallible."<a name="FNanchor_383:1_245" id="FNanchor_383:1_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_383:1_245" class="fnanchor">[383:1]</a></p>

<p>The following letter to the same friend is a curious instance of Hume's
diligent efforts to attain a correct English style:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 8th Dec. 1753.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I am at present reduced to the utmost straits
and difficulties. I know people are commonly ashamed to own
such distresses. But to whom can one have recourse in his
misfortunes, but to his friends? and who can I account my
friend, if not Dr. Clephane? not a friend only in the sunshine
of fortune, but also in the shade of adversity: not a security
only in a calm; but in a storm a sheet-anchor. But, to cut
short all prefaces,&mdash;though, commonly, beggars and authors
abound with them, and I unite both these qualities,&mdash;the
occasion of my distress is as follows:</p>

<p>"You know that the word <em>enough</em>, or <em>enuff</em>, as it is
pronounced by the English, we commonly, in Scotland, when it
is applied to number, pronounce enow. Thus we would say: such
a one has books enow for study, but not leisure enuff. Now I
want to know, whether the English make the same distinction. I
observed the distinction already in Lord Shaftesbury; 'Though
there be doors enow,' says he, 'to get out of life;' and
thinking that this distinction of spelling words, that had
both different letters, and different pronunciation, was an
improvement, I followed it in my learned productions, though I
knew it was not usual. But there has lately arisen in me a
doubt, that this is a mere Scotticism; and that the English
always pronounce the word, as if it were wrote enuff, whether
it be applied to numbers or to quantity. To you, therefore, I
apply in this doubt and perplexity. Though I make no question
that your ear is well purged from all native impurities, yet
trust not entirely to it, but ask any of your English
friends, <!-- Page 385 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_385" id="Page_v1_385">[385]</a></span>that frequent good company, and let me know their
opinion.</p>

<p>"It is a rule of Vaugelas always to consult the ladies, rather
than men, in all doubts of language; and he asserts, that they
have a more delicate sense of the propriety of expressions.
The same author advises us, if we desire any one's opinion in
any grammatical difficulty, not to ask him directly; for that
confounds his memory, and makes him forget the use, which is
the true standard of language. The best way, says he, is to
engage him as it were by accident, to employ the expression
about which we are in doubt. Now, if you are provided of any
expedient, for making the ladies pronounce the word enough,
applied both to quantity and number, I beg you to employ it,
and to observe carefully and attentively, whether they make
any difference in the pronunciation. I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I am quite in earnest in desiring a solution of my
grammatical doubt."<a name="FNanchor_385:1_246" id="FNanchor_385:1_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_385:1_246" class="fnanchor">[385:1]</a></p>

<p>The gentle sensitive character, and hard fate of poor blind Thomas
Blacklock, the poet, operated strongly on Hume's kindly feelings. He
busied himself with many schemes for enabling his unfortunate friend to
gain a subsistence which might make him enjoy "the glorious privilege of
being independent:" but with small success. This appears to be the only
pursuit which he permitted to divert his attention, at this time, from
his great work. We find him writing the following letter to a person
whose position in society might enable him to do some substantial
service to Blacklock.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_386" id="Page_v1_386">[386]</a></span><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Matthew Sharp</span> <i>of Hoddam</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 25th February, 1754.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have enclosed this letter under one to my friend
Mr. Blacklock, who has retired to Dumfries, and proposes to
reside there for some time. His character and situation are no
doubt known to you, and challenge the greatest regard from
every one who has either good taste or sentiments of humanity.
He has printed a collection of poems, which his friends are
endeavouring to turn to the best account for him. Had he
published them in the common way, their merit would have
recommended them sufficiently to common sale; but, in that
case, the greatest part of the profit, it is well known, would
have redounded to the booksellers. His friends, therefore,
take copies from him, and distribute them among their
acquaintances. The poems, if I have the smallest judgment,
are, many of them, extremely beautiful, and all of them
remarkable for correctness and propriety. Every man of taste,
from the merit of the performance, would be inclined to
purchase them: every benevolent man, from the situation of the
author, would wish to encourage him; and, as for those who
have neither taste nor benevolence, they should be forced, by
importunity, to do good against their will. I must, therefore,
recommend it to you to send for a cargo of these poems, which
the author's great modesty will prevent him from offering to
you, and to engage your acquaintance to purchase them. But,
dear sir, I would fain go farther: I would fain presume upon
our friendship, (which now begins to be ancient between us,)
and recommend to your civilities a man who does honour to his
country by his talents, and disgraces it by the little
encouragement he has hitherto met with. He is a man of very
extensive knowledge and of singular <!-- Page 387 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_387" id="Page_v1_387">[387]</a></span>good dispositions; and
his poetical, though very much to be admired, is the least
part of his merit. He is very well qualified to instruct
youth, by his acquaintance both with the languages and
sciences; and possesses so many arts of supplying the want of
sight, that that imperfection would be no hinderance. Perhaps
he may entertain some such project in Dumfries; and be assured
you could not do your friends a more real service than by
recommending them to him. Whatever scheme he may choose to
embrace, I was desirous you should be prepossessed in his
favour, and be willing to lend him your countenance and
protection, which I am sensible would be of great advantage to
him.</p>

<p>"Since I saw you, I have not been idle. I have endeavoured to
make some use of the library which was intrusted to me, and
have employed myself in a composition of British History,
beginning with the union of the two crowns. I have finished
the reigns of James and Charles, and will soon send them to
the press. I have the impudence to pretend that I am of no
party, and have no bias. Lord Elibank says, that I am a
moderate Whig, and Mr. Wallace that I am a candid Tory. I was
extremely sorry that I could not recommend your friend to
Director Hume,<a name="FNanchor_387:1_247" id="FNanchor_387:1_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_387:1_247" class="fnanchor">[387:1]</a> as Mr. Cummin desired me. I have never
exchanged a word with that gentleman since I carried Jemmy
Kirkpatrick to him; and our acquaintance has entirely dropt. I
am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_387:2_248" id="FNanchor_387:2_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_387:2_248" class="fnanchor">[387:2]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Another letter by Hume, longer and fuller of detail, though it has
already appeared in a work well known and much read,<a name="FNanchor_387:3_249" id="FNanchor_387:3_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_387:3_249" class="fnanchor">[387:3]</a> seems to
demand insertion <!-- Page 388 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_388" id="Page_v1_388">[388]</a></span>here. It is addressed to the author of Polymetis and
friend of Pope.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Joseph Spence</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Edinburgh, Oct. 15, 1754.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The agreeable productions, with which you have
entertained the public, have long given me a desire of being
known to you: but this desire has been much increased by my
finding you engage so warmly in protecting a man of merit, so
helpless as Mr. Blacklock. I hope you will indulge me in the
liberty I have taken of writing to you. I shall very willingly
communicate all the particulars I know of him; though others,
by their longer acquaintance with him, are better qualified
for this undertaking.</p>

<p>The first time I had ever seen or heard of Mr. Blacklock was
about twelve years ago, when I met him in a visit to two young
ladies. They informed me of his case, as far as they could in
a conversation carried on in his presence. I soon found him to
possess a very delicate taste, along with a passionate love of
learning. Dr. Stevenson had, at that time, taken him under his
protection; and he was perfecting himself in the Latin tongue.
I repeated to him Mr. Pope's elegy to the memory of an
unfortunate lady, which I happened to have by heart: and
though I be a very bad reciter, I saw it affected him
extremely. His eyes, indeed, the great index of the mind,
could express no passion: but his whole body was thrown into
agitation. That poem was equally qualified to touch the
delicacy of his taste, and the tenderness of his feelings. I
left the town a few days after; and being long absent from
Scotland, I neither saw nor heard of him for several years. At
last an acquaintance of mine told me of him, and said that he
would have waited on me, if his excessive modesty had not
prevented him. He soon appeared what I have ever since found
him, a very elegant genius, of a most affectionate grateful
disposition, a modest backward temper, accompanied with that
delicate pride, which so naturally attends virtue in distress.
His great moderation and frugality, along with the generosity
of a few persons, particularly Dr. Stevenson and Provost
<!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_389" id="Page_v1_389">[389]</a></span>Alexander, had hitherto enabled him to subsist. All his good
qualities are diminished, or rather perhaps embellished, by a
great want of knowledge of the world. Men of very benevolent
or very malignant dispositions are apt to fall into this
error; because they think all mankind like themselves: but I
am sorry to say that the former are apt to be most egregiously
mistaken.</p>

<p>I have asked him whether he retained any idea of light or
colours. He assured me that there remained not the least
traces of them. I found, however, that all the poets, even the
most descriptive ones, such as Milton and Thomson, were read
by him with pleasure. Thomson is one of his favourites. I
remembered a story in Locke of a blind man, who said that he
knew very well what scarlet was: it was like the sound of a
trumpet. I therefore asked him, whether he had not formed
associations of that kind, and whether he did not connect
colour and sound together. He answered, that as he met so
often, both in books and conversation, with the terms
expressing colours, he had formed some false associations,
which supported him when he read, wrote, or talked of colours:
but that the associations were of the intellectual kind. The
illumination of the sun, for instance, he supposed to resemble
the presence of a friend; the cheerful colour of green, to be
like an amiable sympathy, &amp;c. It was not altogether easy for
me to understand him: though I believe, in much of our own
thinking, there will be found some species of association.
'Tis certain we always think in some language, viz. in that
which is most familiar to us; and 'tis but too frequent to
substitute words instead of ideas.</p>

<p>If you was acquainted with any mystic, I fancy you would think
Mr. Blacklock's case less paradoxical. The mystics certainly
have associations by which their discourse, which seems jargon
to us, becomes intelligible to themselves. I believe they
commonly substitute the feelings of a common amour, in the
place of their heavenly sympathies: and if they be not belied,
the type is very apt to engross their hearts, and exclude the
thing typified.</p>

<p>Apropos to this passion, I once said to my friend, Mr.
Blacklock, that I was sure he did not treat love as he did
colours; he did not speak of it without feeling it. There
<!-- Page 390 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_390" id="Page_v1_390">[390]</a></span>appeared too much reality in all his expressions to allow that
to be suspected. "Alas!" said he, with a sigh, "I could never
bring my heart to a proper tranquillity on that head." Your
passion, replied I, will always be better founded than ours,
who have sight: we are so foolish as to allow ourselves to be
captivated by exterior beauty: nothing but the beauty of the
mind can affect you. "Not altogether neither," said he: "the
sweetness of the voice has a mighty effect upon me: the
symptoms of youth too, which the touch discovers, have great
influence. And though such familiar approaches would be
ill-bred in others, the girls of my acquaintance indulge me,
on account of my blindness, with the liberty of running over
them with my hand. And I can by that means judge entirely of
their shape. However, no doubt, humour, and temper, and sense,
and other beauties of the mind, have an influence upon me as
upon others."</p>

<p>You may see from this conversation how difficult it is even
for a blind man to be a perfect Platonic. But though Mr.
Blacklock never wants his Evanthe, who is the real object of
his poetical addresses, I am well assured that all his
passions have been perfectly consistent with the purest virtue
and innocence. His life indeed has been in all respects
perfectly irreproachable.</p>

<p>He had got some rudiments of Latin in his youth, but could not
easily read a Latin author till he was near twenty, when Dr.
Stevenson put him to a grammar school in Edinburgh. He got a
boy to lead him, whom he found very docible; and he taught him
Latin. This boy accompanied him to the Greek class in the
College, and they both learned Greek. Mr. Blacklock
understands that language perfectly, and has read with a very
lively pleasure all the Greek authors of taste. Mr. William
Alexander, second son to our late provost, and present member,
was so good as to teach him French; and he is quite master of
that language. He has a very tenacious memory and a quick
apprehension. The young students of the College were very
desirous of his company, and he reaped the advantage of their
eyes, and they of his instructions. He is a very good
philosopher, and in general possesses all branches of
erudition, except the mathematical. The lad who first attended
him having <!-- Page 391 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_391" id="Page_v1_391">[391]</a></span>left him, he has got another boy, whom he is
beginning to instruct; and he writes me that he is extremely
pleased with his docility. The boy's parents, who are people
of substance, have put him into Mr. Blacklock's service,
chiefly on account of the virtuous and learned education which
they know he gives his pupils.</p>

<p>As you are so generous to interest yourself in this poor man's
case, who is so much an object both of admiration and
compassion, I must inform you entirely of his situation. He
has gained about one hundred guineas by this last edition of
his poems, and this is the whole stock he has in the world. He
has also a bursary, about six pounds a-year. I begun a
subscription for supporting him during five years; and I made
out twelve guineas a-year among my acquaintance. That is a
most terrible undertaking; and some unexpected refusals I met
with, damped me, though they have not quite discouraged me
from proceeding. We have the prospect of another bursary of
ten pounds a-year in the gift of the exchequer; but to the
shame of human nature, we met with difficulties. Noblemen
interpose with their valet-de-chambres or nurses' sons, who
they think would be burdens on themselves. Could we ensure but
thirty pounds a-year to this fine genius and man of virtue, he
would be easy and happy: for his wants are none but those
which Nature has given him, though she has unhappily loaded
him with more than other men.</p>

<p>His want of knowledge of the world, and the great delicacy of
his temper, render him unfit for managing boys or teaching a
school: he would retain no authority. Had it not been for this
defect, he could have been made professor of Greek in the
University of Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Your scheme of publishing his poems by subscription, I hope
will turn to account. I think it impossible he could want,
were his case more generally known. I hope it will be so by
your means. Sir George Lyttleton, who has so fine a taste, and
so much benevolence of temper, would certainly, were the case
laid before him in a just light, lend his assistance, or
rather indeed quite overcome all difficulties. I know not,
whether you have the happiness of that gentleman's
acquaintance.</p>

<p><!-- Page 392 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_392" id="Page_v1_392">[392]</a></span>As you are a lover of letters, I shall inform you of a piece
of news, which will be agreeable to you: we may hope to see
good tragedies in the English language. A young man called
Hume, a clergyman of this country, discovers a very fine
genius for that species of composition. Some years ago, he
wrote a tragedy called Agis, which some of the best judges,
such as the Duke of Argyle, Sir George Lyttleton, Mr. Pitt,
very much approved of. I own, though I could perceive fine
strokes in that tragedy, I never could in general bring myself
to like it: the author, I thought, had corrupted his taste by
the imitation of Shakspere, whom he ought only to have
admired. But the same author has composed a new tragedy on a
subject of invention; and here he appears a true disciple of
Sophocles and Racine. I hope in time he will vindicate the
English stage from the reproach of barbarism.</p>

<p>I shall be very glad if the employing my name in your account
of Mr. Blacklock can be of any service. I am, Sir, with great
regard, &amp;c.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Mr. Blacklock is very docible, and glad to receive
corrections. I am only afraid he is too apt to have a
deference for other people's judgment. I did not see the last
edition till it was printed; but I have sent him some
objections to passages, for which he was very thankful. I also
desired him to retrench some poems entirely; such as the Ode
on Fortitude, and some others, which seemed to me inferior to
the rest of the collection. You will very much oblige him, if
you use the same freedom. I remarked to him some Scotticisms;
but you are better qualified for doing him that service. I
have not seen any of his essays; and am afraid his prose is
inferior to his poetry. He will soon be in town, when I shall
be enabled to write you further particulars.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1756, Spence published his edition of Blacklock's poems, with a long
introduction, in which all allusion to Hume's letter, and his services
to Blacklock, is carefully avoided. Blacklock was subsequently
<!-- Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_393" id="Page_v1_393">[393]</a></span>alienated from Hume, and was accused by some of ingratitude; while
others threw the odium of the dispute on Hume, who, they said, was
mortified because Spence's edition of Blacklock's Poems was not
dedicated to him. Whoever may have been in the wrong, the latter
supposition is erroneous, as we shall find Hume at a much later period
conferring services on Blacklock, who in his turn gratefully
acknowledges them. The zeal of Spence to blot from the work any mark
that might connect it with the name of Hume, is alluded to with
good-natured sarcasm, in a letter to Dr. Clephane, farther on.</p>

<p>The following letter, connected with another curious circumstance,
describes an incident in Hume's conduct to Blacklock.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 17th December, 1754.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I told you that I intended to apply to the Faculty
for redress; and, if refused, to throw up the library. I was
assured that two of the curators intended before the Faculty
to declare their willingness to redress me, after which there
could be no difficulty to gain a victory over the other two.
But before the day came, the Dean prevailed on them to change
their resolution, and joined them himself with all his
interest. I saw it then impossible to succeed, and accordingly
retracted my application. But being equally unwilling to lose
the use of the books, and to bear an indignity, I retain the
office, but have given Blacklock, our blind poet, a bond of
annuity for the salary. I have now put it out of these
malicious fellows' power to offer me any indignity, while my
motive for remaining in this office is so apparent. I <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_394" id="Page_v1_394">[394]</a></span>should
be glad that you approve of my conduct. I own I am satisfied
with myself."<a name="FNanchor_394:1_250" id="FNanchor_394:1_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_394:1_250" class="fnanchor">[394:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The following minute or memorandum, in Hume's handwriting,<a name="FNanchor_394:2_251" id="FNanchor_394:2_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_394:2_251" class="fnanchor">[394:2]</a>
explains the ground of his disgust. One of the "malicious fellows"
appears to have been Lord Monboddo; another, Sir David Dalrymple,
afterwards Lord Hailes, with whom he never was on very cordial terms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 27th June, 1754.</p>

<p>"This day Mr. James Burnet, [Mr. Thomas <!-- Page 395 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_395" id="Page_v1_395">[395]</a></span>Millar,] and Sir
David Dalrymple, curators of the library, (then follow some
arrangement as to meetings,) having gone through some accounts
of books, lately bought for the library, and finding therein
the three following French books, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Contes de La Fontaine</span>,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules</span>, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Écumoire</span>, they ordain
that the said books be struck out of the catalogue of the
library, and removed from the shelves as indecent books, and
unworthy of a place in a learned library.</p>

<p>"And to prevent the like abuses in time to come, they appoint
that after this no books shall be bought for the library,
without the authority of a meeting of the curators in time of
session, and of two of them in time of vacation."</p>
</div>

<p>It involves no approval of the licentious features of French literature,
to pronounce this resolution of the curators pre-eminently absurd. A
public library, purged of every book of which any portion might offend
the taste of a well-regulated mind of the present day, would
unfortunately be very barren in the most brilliant departments of the
literature of other days and other languages. It would be wrong in the
guardians of a public library to advance to the dignity of its shelves,
those loathsome books written for the promotion of vice, of which,
though they be published by no eminent bookseller, exhibited on no
respectable counter, advertised in no newspaper, too many have found
their way, by secret avenues, into the heart of society, where they
corrupt its life-blood. But if Greece, Rome, and France,&mdash;if our own
ancestors, had a freer tone in their imaginative literature than we
have, we must yet admit their works to our libraries, if we would have
these institutions depositaries of the genius of all times and all
places. The <!-- Page 396 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_396" id="Page_v1_396">[396]</a></span>Faculty of Advocates are probably not less virtuous at this
moment than they were in 1754, yet they have now on their shelves the
brilliant edition of all La Fontaine's works, published at Amsterdam in
1762,&mdash;so that the expurgatory zeal of the three curators, had only put
their constituents to the expense of replacing the condemned
book.<a name="FNanchor_396:1_252" id="FNanchor_396:1_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:1_252" class="fnanchor">[396:1]</a> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Écumoire</span> may also still be found in the Advocates'
library, along with the other still more censurable works of its author,
Crebillon the younger, who was certainly a free writer, but scarcely
deserved the very opprobrious name which he obtained, of the French
Petronius. Hume was afterwards the acquaintance and correspondent of
this author, who was anxious to hear that his works were well received
in Britain. Would Hume tell him that it was considered in Edinburgh an
offence against decency, to admit one of them to a national library? The
other condemned work, which is generally attributed to Bussy Rabutin, is
not now to be found in the catalogues of the Advocates' library.<a name="FNanchor_396:2_253" id="FNanchor_396:2_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:2_253" class="fnanchor">[396:2]</a></p>

<p>Amidst such unpleasant interruptions he brought the first volume of his
History to a conclusion; and thus announces the fact to a friend, while
in the <!-- Page 397 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_397" id="Page_v1_397">[397]</a></span>midst of his satisfaction he does not forget poor Blacklock.</p>

winter he went to pay a visit to a deacon's wife, who
<!-- Page 398 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_398" id="Page_v1_398">[398]</a></span>happened in that very instant to be gutting fish. He came up
to her with open arms, and said he hoped madam was well, and
that the young ladies her daughters were in good health. 'Oh,

<p>"There is a young man of this country, Mr. Thomas Blacklock,
who has discovered a very fine genius for poetry, and under
very extraordinary circumstances. He is the son of a poor
tradesman, and was born blind; yet, notwithstanding these
disadvantages, he has been able to acquire a great knowledge
of Greek, Latin, and French, and to be well acquainted with
all the classics in these languages, as well as in our own. He
published last winter a volume of Miscellanies, which all men
of taste admired extremely for their purity, elegance, and
correctness; nor were they devoid of force and invention. I
sent up half-a-dozen to Dodsley, desiring him to keep one, and
to distribute the rest among men of taste of his acquaintance.
I find they have been much approved of, and that Mr. Spence,
in particular, has entertained thoughts of printing a new
edition by subscription, for the benefit of the author. You
are an acquaintance of Mr. Spence: encourage, I beseech you,
so benevolent a thought, and promote it every where by your
recommendation. The young man has a great deal of modesty,

notwithstanding very strict frugality, is in great
necessities; but curst, or blest, with that honest pride of
nature, which makes him uneasy under obligations, <!-- Page 399 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_399" id="Page_v1_399">[399]</a></span>and disdain
all applications. I need say no more to you. Dear Doctor,

</div>

<p>Before the year 1754 came to an end, there was published, in a quarto
volume of four hundred and seventy-three pages, "The History of Great
Britain. Volume I. Containing the reigns of James I. and Charles I. By
David Hume, Esq."<a name="FNanchor_399:2_255" id="FNanchor_399:2_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_399:2_255" class="fnanchor">[399:2]</a> He had now laid the foundation of a title to
that which all the genius and originality of his philosophical works
would never have procured for him&mdash;the reputation of a popular author.
His other works might exhibit a wider and a more original grasp of
thought: but the readers of metaphysics and ethics are a small number;
while the readers of history, and especially of the history of their own
country, are a community nearly as great as the number of those who can
read their own language. In this large market he produced his ware; and
after some hesitation on the part of those ordinary readers, who had
never known his genius as a philosopher, and of those who knew his
previous writings, but did not esteem them, it took the place of a
permanent marketable commodity&mdash;a sort of necessary of literary life.
The general reader found in it a distinct and animated narrative,
announced in a style easy, strong, and elegant. The philosopher and
statesman found in it profound and original views, such as the author of
the "Treatise of Human Nature" could not wield the pen without
occasionally dropping on his page. It was a work at once great in its
excellencies and beauties, and <!-- Page 400 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_400" id="Page_v1_400">[400]</a></span>great in its defects; yet even the
latter circumstance swelled its fame, by producing a host of
controversial attacks, conducted by no mean champions. No author or
speaker could launch into a defence of monarchical prerogative without
triumphantly citing the opinion of Hume;&mdash;no friend of any popular
cause, from Chatham downwards, could appeal to history without
condemning his plausible perversions. No season of a debating society
has ever ended without the vexed questions he has started being
discussed in conjunction with his name. Every newspaper has recorded the
editor's opinion of the tendency of Hume's History. In reviews and
magazines, and political pamphlets, the references, laudatory or
condemnatory, are still, notwithstanding all that has been done for
British history in later times, unceasing; and some books, of no small
bulk, have been written, solely against the History, as one pamphlet is
written against another.</p>

<p>Of a book which is so universally known, and has been subjected to so
thorough a critical examination, both in its narrative and its
reflective parts, a detailed criticism in a work like the present would
be superfluous and unwelcome. But the great extent of the controversial
writings on the subject, the quantity of able criticism which the
controversy has produced, the new light it has frequently been the means
of throwing on portions of British history, and the variety of
contending opinions it has elicited, do, in some measure, enable one who
is partial to that kind of reading, to note slightly and fugitively the
leading opinions which this controversy has developed; and thus, looking
back through the whole vista of debate and inquiry, to describe, in
general terms, the estimate which those who have since Hume's time
studied <!-- Page 401 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_401" id="Page_v1_401">[401]</a></span>British history to best effect, have formed of his great work.
Perhaps, for casting a glance at the general principles he has announced
as to the progress of the constitution and public opinion in Britain, as
well as the general scope and extent of his historical labours, his work
may be divided into two leading departments; the history from the
accession of the house of Tudor downwards, which he completed in 1759;
and the history anterior to that epoch, which was published at a later
period of his life. In this arrangement, the general observations will
find their place in a subsequent portion of this work; while, in the
meantime, the opinions entertained of the narrative department of the
volume, published in 1754, may be noticed.</p>

<p>The chief charge brought against it has been, that in describing the
great conflict which ended in the protectorate, the author has shown a
partiality to the side of the monarch, and particularly to Charles I.
and his followers; and has endeavoured to make the opposite
side&mdash;Independents, Presbyterians, Republicans, or under whatever name
they raised the banner of opposition to the court&mdash;odious and
ridiculous.</p>

<p>Before Hume's day, every historian of those times took his side from the
beginning of the narrative, and proclaimed himself either the champion
or the opponent of the monarchical party. Salmon, Echard, and
Carte<a name="FNanchor_401:1_256" id="FNanchor_401:1_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_401:1_256" class="fnanchor">[401:1]</a> wrote histories, in which, if they had spoken with decency
or temper of Oliver Cromwell, the Long Parliament, the Presbyterians, or
the Independents, they would have felt that they had as much neglected
their duty, as an advocate who, seeing some <!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_402" id="Page_v1_402">[402]</a></span>irregularity in the case of
the opposite party, fails to take advantage of it. The title-page of
Salmon announced his project: it promised "Remarks on Rapin, Burnet, and
other Republican writers, vindicating the just right of the Established
Church, and the prerogatives of the crown, against the wild schemes of
enthusiasts and levellers, no less active and diligent in promoting the
subversion of this beautiful frame of government, than their artful
predecessors in hypocrisy," &amp;c. But Hume professed to approach the
subject as a philosopher, and to hold the balance even between Salmon
and Echard on the one side, and Oldmixon and Rapin on the other. Hence,
when it was believed that, under this air of impartiality, he masked a
battery well loaded and skilfully pointed against the principles of the
constitution, and the efforts of those who had fought for freedom, a
louder cry of indignation was raised against him than had ever assailed
the avowed retainers of the anti-popular cause.</p>

<p>The tendency of the History was unexpected and inexplicable. In his
philosophical examination of the principles of government, written in
times of hot party feeling, he had discarded the theories of arbitrary
prerogative and divine right with bold and calm disdain. His utilitarian
theory represented the good of the people, not the will or advantage of
any one man, or small class of men, as the right object of government.
Harrison, Milton, and Sidney, had not expressed opinions more thoroughly
democratic than his. "Few things," says a critic, well accustomed to
trace literary anomalies to their causes in the minds of their authors,
"are more unaccountable, and, indeed, absurd, than that Hume should have
taken part with high church and high monarchy men. The persecutions
<!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_403" id="Page_v1_403">[403]</a></span>which he suffered in his youth from the Presbyterians, may, perhaps,
have influenced his ecclesiastical partialities.<a name="FNanchor_403:1_257" id="FNanchor_403:1_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:1_257" class="fnanchor">[403:1]</a> But that he
should have sided with the Tudors and the Stuarts against the people,
seems quite inconsistent with all the great traits of his character. His
unrivalled sagacity must have looked with contempt on the preposterous
arguments by which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus divinum</i> was maintained. His natural
benevolence must have suggested the cruelty of subjecting the enjoyments
of thousands to the caprice of one unfeeling individual; and his own
practical independence in private life, might have taught him the value
of those feelings which he has so mischievously derided."<a name="FNanchor_403:2_258" id="FNanchor_403:2_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_403:2_258" class="fnanchor">[403:2]</a></p>

<p>In truth, it does not appear that Hume had begun his work with the
intention of adopting a side in the politics of the time; and that
sympathy, rather than rational conviction or political prejudice,
dictated his partisanship. His misapprehensions regarding the state of
the constitution, and the early foundation of British liberties, may be
attributed to another cause; but in his treatment of the question
between Charles I. and his opponents, he appears to have set out with
the design of preserving a rigid neutrality; to have gradually felt his
sympathies wavering,&mdash;to have at first restrained them, then let them
sway him slightly from the even middle path, and finally allowed them to
take possession of his opinions; opinions which, in their form of
expression, still preserved that <!-- Page 404 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_404" id="Page_v1_404">[404]</a></span>tone of calm impartiality with which
he had set out. In the work of Clarendon&mdash;a scholar, a gentleman, a
dignified and elegant writer, a man of high-toned and manly feeling&mdash;he
found an attractive guide. In looking at the structure of Hume's
narrative, we can see that Clarendon was the author, whose account of
the great conflict was chiefly present to his mind; and dwelling on his
words and ideas, he must have in some measure felt the influence of that
plausible writer. As he went on with his narrative, he found on the one
side refinement and heroism, an elevated and learned priesthood, a
chivalrous aristocracy, a refined court,&mdash;all "the divinity" that "doth
hedge a king," followed by all the sad solemnity of fallen
greatness,&mdash;an adverse contest, borne with steady courage, and
humiliation and death endured with patient magnanimity. On the other
side appeared plebeian thoughts, rude uncivil speech, barbarous and
ludicrous fanaticism, and success consummated by ungenerous triumphs.
His philosophical indifference gave way before such temptations, and he
went the way of his sympathies. Yet he never permitted himself boldly
and distinctly to profess partisanship: he still bore the badge of
neutrality; and perhaps believed that he was swerving neither to the
right hand nor to the left. An eloquent writer has thus vividly
described the tone of his History:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Hume, without positively asserting more than he can prove,
gives prominence to all the circumstances which can support
his case. He glides lightly over those which are unfavourable
to it. His own witnesses are applauded and encouraged; the
statements which seem to throw discredit on them are
controverted; the contradictions into which they fall are
explained away; a clear and connected abstract of their
evidence is given. Every thing that is offered on <!-- Page 405 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_405" id="Page_v1_405">[405]</a></span>the other
side is scrutinized with the utmost severity; every suspicious
circumstance is a ground for comment and invective; what
cannot be denied is extenuated, or passed by without notice.
Concessions even are sometimes made; but this insidious
candour only increases the effect of this vast mass of
sophistry.<a name="FNanchor_405:1_259" id="FNanchor_405:1_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_405:1_259" class="fnanchor">[405:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet when there was any thing of a grand and solemn character in the
proceedings of the Republican party,&mdash;when they were not connected with
the rude guards, and their insults to the fallen majesty of England;
with the long psalms, long sermons, and long faces of the Puritans; with
Trouble-world Lilburne, Praise-God Barebones, or eccentric, stubborn,
impracticable William Prynne,&mdash;he could employ the easy majesty of his
language in surrounding them with a suiting dignity of tone; and he did
so with apparent pleasure. Witness his description of the meeting of the
Long Parliament, and of the preparations for the king's trial before the
High Court of Justice.</p>

<p>He seems to have felt, not unfrequently, the inconsistencies that must
be perceptible between the tone of his historical, and the political
doctrines of his philosophical works; and his attempts to reconcile them
with each other, sometimes only serve to make the difference more
conspicuous. Speaking of the act of holding judgment on Charles I., he
says, "If ever, on any occasion, it were laudable to conceal truth from
the populace, it must be confessed that the doctrine of resistance
affords such an example; and that all speculative reasoners ought to
observe, with regard to this principle, the same cautious silence which
the laws, in every species of government, have ever <!-- Page 406 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_406" id="Page_v1_406">[406]</a></span>prescribed to
themselves." One could imagine a congress of crowned heads, or a
conclave of cardinals, adopting such a view; and resolving, at the same
moment, that it should be kept as secret as the grave. But that a man
should speak of the right of resistance as existing, and say the
knowledge of it ought not to be promulgated, and print and publish this
in a book in his own vernacular language, is surely as remarkable an
anomaly, as the history of practical contradictions can exhibit.</p>

<p>Owing to his opinion of the manner in which the Abbé Le Blanc had
rendered his "Political Discourses" into French, he expressed a wish, in
the following courteous letter, that the History should have the benefit
of being translated by the same hand.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Abbé Le Blanc</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 15th October, 1754.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;You will receive, along with this, a copy of the first
volume of my 'History of Great Britain,' which will be
published next winter in London. The honour which you did me
in translating my 'Political Discourses,' inspires me with an
ambition of desiring to have this work translated by the same
excellent hand. The great curiosity of the events related in
this volume, embellished by your elegant pen, might challenge
the attention of the public. If you do not undertake this
translation, I despair of ever seeing it done in a
satisfactory manner. Many intricacies in the English
government,&mdash;many customs peculiar to this island, require
explication; and it will be necessary to accompany the
translation with some notes, however short, in order to render
it intelligible to foreigners. None but a person as well
acquainted as you with England and the English constitution,
can pretend to <!-- Page 407 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_407" id="Page_v1_407">[407]</a></span>clear up obscurities, or explain the
difficulties which occur. If, at any time, you find yourself
at a loss, be so good as to inform me. I shall spare no pains
to solve all doubts; and convey all the lights which, by my
long and assiduous study of the subject, I may have acquired.
The distance betwixt us need be no impediment to this
correspondence. If you favour me frequently with your letters,
I shall be able to render you the same service as if I had the
happiness of living next door to you, and was able to inspect
the whole translation. In this attempt, the knowledge of the
two languages is but one circumstance to qualify a man for a
translator. Though your attainments, in this respect, be known
to all the world, I own that I trust more to the spirit of

<p>The Abbé received the proposal with rapture: he offered to translate
with the zeal not only of the illustrious author's admirer, but of his
friend. He desired Hume to postpone the publication for a while in
London, and to send him the sheets with the utmost rapidity, lest he
might be forestalled by some of that numerous host of rapid penmen, who
are ready, in obedience to the commands of the booksellers, to translate
such works, without knowing English, or even French. Holland was at that
period a great book mart, and there the Abbé found rivals still more
expeditious; for he was obliged to write to Hume, at a time when he
seems to have made little or no progress <!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_408" id="Page_v1_408">[408]</a></span>with his work, stating that he
is disheartened by the prospect of the immediate appearance of a
translation in Holland, where they employ, in the rendering of excellent
books into French, people who are only fit to manufacture paper. In the
end, having encountered a host of interruptions, he intimates that he
has placed the work in the hands of another person.<a name="FNanchor_408:1_261" id="FNanchor_408:1_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_408:1_261" class="fnanchor">[408:1]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Oct. 18th, 1754.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I received your kind letter, for which I thank
you. Poor Aber<a name="FNanchor_408:2_262" id="FNanchor_408:2_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_408:2_262" class="fnanchor">[408:2]</a> is disappointed by a train of Norland

to you a copy of my History, as soon as it arrives in London,
and before it be published. Lend it not till it be published.
It contains no paradoxes, and very little profaneness,&mdash;as
little as could be expected. The Abbé Le Blanc, who has
translated some other of my pieces, intends to translate it,
and the enclosed is part of a copy I send him: excuse the
freedom&mdash;you may perhaps receive some other packets of the
same kind, which you will please to send carefully to the
post-house. The General and Sir Henry are in town, who
remember you. Edmonstone is well, and I just now left him
a-bed. I may perhaps be in London for good and all in a year
or two. Show me that frugality could make £120 a-year do, and
I am with you: a man of letters ought always to live in a
capital, says Bayle. I believe I have no more to say. You'll
own that my style has not become more verbose, on account of
my writing quartos. Yours affectionately," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_409:1_263" id="FNanchor_409:1_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_409:1_263" class="fnanchor">[409:1]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"9th October.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;As I send you a long book, you will allow me to
write a short letter, with this fruit of near two years' very
constant application, my youngest and dearest child. You
should have read it sooner; but, during the fine weather, I
foresaw that it would produce some inconvenience: either you
would attach yourself so much to the perusal of me, as to
neglect walking, riding, and field diversions, which are much
more beneficial than any history; or if this beautiful season
tempted you, I must lie in a corner, neglected and forgotten.
I assure you I would take the pet if so treated. Now that the
weather has at last broke, and long nights are joined to wind
and rain, and that a fireside has become the most agreeable
object, a new book, especially if wrote by a friend, may not
be unwelcome. In expectation, then, that you are to peruse me
first with pleasure, then with ease, I expect to hear your
remarks, and Mr. Dysart's, and the Solicitor's. Whether am I
Whig or Tory? Protestant or Papist? Scotch or English? I hope
you do not all agree on this head, and that there are disputes
among you about my principles. We never see you in town, <!-- Page 411 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_411" id="Page_v1_411">[411]</a></span>and
I can never get to the country; but I hope I preserve a place
in your memory. I am, &amp;c.</p>

it is a very fine thing. He now discovers a great genius for
the theatre."</p>

<p>In a continuation of the letter, of which the part relating to Blacklock
was cited <a href="#Page_v1_393">above</a>, he thus desires Adam Smith's opinion of the History:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Pray tell me, and tell me ingenuously, what success has my
History met with among the judges with you. I mean Dr. Cullen,
Mr. Betham, Mrs. Betham, Mr. Leichman, Mr. Muirhead, Mr.
Crawford, &amp;c. Dare I presume that it has been thought worthy
of examination, and that its beauties are found to overbalance
its defects? I am very desirous to know my errors; and I dare
swear you think me tolerably docile to be so veteran an
author. I cannot, indeed, hope soon to have an opportunity of
correcting my errors; this impression is so very numerous. The
sale, indeed, has been very great in Edinburgh; but how it
goes on in London, we have not been precisely informed. In all
cases I am desirous of storing up instruction; and as you are
now idle, (I mean, have nothing but your class to teach,
<!-- Page 412 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_412" id="Page_v1_412">[412]</a></span>which to you is comparative idleness,) I will insist upon
hearing from you.</p>

<p class="datelineit">"Edinburgh, 17th Dec. 1754."</p>
</div>

<p>The following letter, still on the same subject, introduces the name of
a new correspondent.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Earl</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Balcarres</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 17th December, 1754.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I did really intend to have paid my respects to
your lordship this harvest; but I have got into such a
recluse, studious habit, that I believe myself only fit to
converse with books; and, however I may pretend to be
acquainted with dead kings, shall become quite unsuitable for
my friends and cotemporaries. Besides, the great gulf that is
fixed between us terrifies me. I am not only very sick at sea,
but often can scarce get over the sickness for some days.</p>

<p>"I am very proud that my History, even upon second thoughts,
appears to have something tolerable in your lordship's eyes.
It has been very much canvassed and read here in town, as I am
told; and it has full as many inveterate enemies as partial
defenders. The misfortune of a book, says Boileau, is not the
being ill spoke of, but the not being spoken of at all. The
sale has been very considerable here, about four hundred and
fifty copies in five weeks. How it has succeeded in London, I
cannot precisely tell; only I observe that some of the weekly
papers have been busy with me.&mdash;I am as great an Atheist as
Bolingbroke; as great a Jacobite as Carte; I cannot write
English, &amp;c. I do, indeed, observe that the book is in general
rather more agreeable to those they call Tories; and I
believe, chiefly for this <!-- Page 413 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_413" id="Page_v1_413">[413]</a></span>reason, that, having no places to
bestow, they are naturally more moderate in their expectations
from a writer. A Whig, who can give hundreds a-year, will not
be contented with small sacrifices of truth; and most authors
are willing to purchase favour at so reasonable a price.</p>

<p>"I wish it were in my power to pass this Christmas at
Balcarres. I should be glad to accompany your lordship in your
rural improvements, and return thence to relish with pleasure
the comforts of your fireside. You enjoy peace and
contentment, my lord, which all the power and wealth of the
nation cannot give to our rulers. The whole ministry, they
say, is by the ears. This quarrel, I hope, they will fight out
among themselves, and not expect to draw us in as formerly, by
pretending it is for our good. We will not be the dupes twice
in our life.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to be, my lord, your lordship's most
obedient and most humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_413:1_267" id="FNanchor_413:1_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_413:1_267" class="fnanchor">[413:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The literary success that would satisfy Hume <!-- Page 414 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_414" id="Page_v1_414">[414]</a></span>required to be of no small
amount. Though neither, in any sense, a vain man, nor a caterer for
ephemeral applause, he was greedy of fame; and what would have been to
others pre-eminent success, appears to have, in his eyes, scarcely risen
above failure. His expressions about the reception of his History, have
a tinge of morbidness. In John Home's memorandum of his latest
conversations, it is said that "he recurred to a subject not unfrequent
with him, that is, the design to ruin him as an author, by the people
that were ministers at the first publication of his History."<a name="FNanchor_414:1_268" id="FNanchor_414:1_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_414:1_268" class="fnanchor">[414:1]</a> In
his "own life," written at the same time, the only passage truly bitter
in its tone, gives fuller expression to a like feeling:&mdash;"I was, I own,
sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work. I thought that
I was the only historian that had at once neglected present power,
interest, and authority, and the cry of popular prejudices; and as the
subject was suited to every capacity, I expected proportional applause.
But miserable was my disappointment: I was assailed by one cry of
reproach, disapprobation, and even detestation; English, Scotch, and
Irish, Whig and Tory, Churchman and Sectary, Freethinker and
Religionist, Patriot and Courtier, united in their rage against the man
who had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and
the Earl of Strafford; and after the first ebullitions of their fury
were over, what was still more mortifying, the book seemed to sink into
oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he sold only
forty-five copies of it. I scarcely, indeed, heard <!-- Page 415 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_415" id="Page_v1_415">[415]</a></span>of one man in the
three kingdoms, considerable for rank or letters, that could endure the
book. I must only except the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the
primate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions. These
dignified prelates separately sent me messages not to be discouraged.</p>

<p>"I was however, I confess, discouraged; and had not the war been, at
that time, breaking out between France and England, I had certainly
retired to some provincial town of the former kingdom, have changed my
name, and never more have returned to my native country. But as this
scheme was not now practicable, and the subsequent volume was
considerably advanced, I resolved to pick up courage, and to persevere."</p>

<p>Andrew Millar, a countryman of Hume, had, about this time, formed an
extensive publishing connexion in London. An arrangement was made, by
which he should take the History under his protection,&mdash;publish the
subsequent volumes, and push the sale of the first. The arrangement is
said to have been recommended by Hume's Edinburgh publishers; and it
shows how much, in that age, as probably also in this, even a great work
may depend on the publisher's exertions, for giving it a hold on the
public mind. Hume had a pretty extensive correspondence with Millar.
Many of the letters are purely on business, and sometimes on business
not very important; but others, such as the following, have some
literary interest. Hume appears to have contemplated a translation of
Plutarch, and Millar seems to have wished to make him editor of a London
newspaper.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"12th April, 1755.</p>

<p>"The second volume of my History I can easily find <!-- Page 416 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_416" id="Page_v1_416">[416]</a></span>a way of
conveying to you when finished and corrected, and fairly
copied. Perhaps I may be in London myself about that time. I
have always said, to all my acquaintance, that if the first
volume bore a little of a Tory aspect, the second would
probably be as grateful to the opposite party. The two first
princes of the house of Stuart were certainly more excusable
than the two second. The constitution was, in their time, very
ambiguous and undetermined; and their parliaments were, in
many respects, refractory and obstinate. But Charles the
Second knew that he had succeeded to a very limited monarchy.
His long parliament was indulgent to him, and even consisted
almost entirely of royalists. Yet he could not be quiet, nor
contented with a legal authority. I need not mention the
oppressions in Scotland, nor the absurd conduct of King James
the Second. These are obvious and glaring points. Upon the
whole, I wish the two volumes had been published together.
Neither one party nor the other would, in that case, have had
the least pretext of reproaching me with partiality.</p>

<p>"I shall give no farther umbrage to the godly, though I am far
from thinking, that my liberties on that head have been the
real cause of checking the sale of the first volume. They
might afford a pretext for decrying it to those who were
resolved on other accounts to lay hold of pretexts.</p>

<p>"Pray tell Dr. Birch, if you have occasion to see him, that
his story of the warrant for Lord Loudon's execution, though
at first I thought it highly improbable, appears to me at
present a great deal more likely.<a name="FNanchor_416:1_269" id="FNanchor_416:1_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_416:1_269" class="fnanchor">[416:1]</a> I find the same story
in "Scotstarvet's <!-- Page 417 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_417" id="Page_v1_417">[417]</a></span>Staggering State,"<a name="FNanchor_417:1_270" id="FNanchor_417:1_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_417:1_270" class="fnanchor">[417:1]</a> which was
published here a few months ago. The same story, coming from
different canals, without any dependence on each other, bears
a strong air of probability. I have spoke to Duke Hamilton,
who says, that I shall be very welcome to peruse all his
papers. I shall take the first opportunity of going to the
bottom of that affair; and if I find any confirmation of the
suspicion, will be sure to inform Dr. Birch. I own it is the
strongest instance of any which history affords, of King
Charles's arbitrary principles.</p>

<p>"I have made a trial of Plutarch, and find that I take
pleasure in it; but cannot yet form so just a notion of the
time and pains which it will require, as to tell you what sum
of money I would think an equivalent. But I shall be sure to
inform you as soon as I come to a resolution. The notes
requisite will not be numerous,&mdash;not so many as in the former
edition. I think so bulky a book ought to be swelled as little
as possible; and nothing added but what is absolutely
requisite. The little trial I have made, convinces me that the
undertaking will require time. My manner of composing is slow,
and I have great difficulty to satisfy myself."<a name="FNanchor_417:2_271" id="FNanchor_417:2_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_417:2_271" class="fnanchor">[417:2]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 9th January, 1755.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg you to make my compliments to the
Society,<a name="FNanchor_417:3_272" id="FNanchor_417:3_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_417:3_272" class="fnanchor">[417:3]</a> and to take the fault on yourself, if I <!-- Page 418 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_418" id="Page_v1_418">[418]</a></span>have
not executed my duty, and sent them, this time, my anniversary
paper. Had I got a week's warning I should have been able to
have supplied them. I should willingly have sent some sheets
of the history of the Commonwealth, or Protectorship; but they
are all of them out of my hand at present, and I have not been
able to recall them.</p>

<p>"I think you are extremely in the right, that the Parliament's
bigotry has nothing in common with Hiero's generosity. They
were, themselves, violent persecutors at home, to the utmost
of their power. Besides, the Hugunots in France were not
persecuted; they were really seditious, turbulent people, whom
their king was not able to reduce to obedience. The French
persecutions did not begin till sixty years after.</p>

<p>"Your objection to the Irish massacre is just, but falls not
on the execution, but the subject. Had I been to describe the
massacre of Paris, I should not have fallen into that fault.
But, in the Irish massacre, no single eminent man fell, or by
a remarkable death.<a name="FNanchor_418:1_273" id="FNanchor_418:1_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_418:1_273" class="fnanchor">[418:1]</a> If the elocution of the whole

</div>

<p>We shall have farther occasion to notice the deep interest which Hume
took in John Home's tragedy of Douglas. The following letter, which is
without date, was, probably, written at the beginning of the year 1755,
and before Home made his unsuccessful journey <!-- Page 419 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_419" id="Page_v1_419">[419]</a></span>to London, to submit his
effort to the judgment of Garrick.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">John Home</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;With great pleasure I have more than once perused
your tragedy. It is interesting, affecting, pathetic. The
story is simple and natural; but what chiefly delights me, is
to find the language so pure, correct, and moderate. For God's
sake read Shakspere, but get Racine and Sophocles by heart. It
is reserved to you, and you alone, to redeem our stage from
the reproach of barbarism.</p>

<p>"I have not forgot your request to find fault; but as you had
neither numbered the pages nor the lines in your copy, I
cannot point out particular expressions. I have marked the
margin, and shall tell you my opinion when I have the pleasure
of seeing you. The more considerable objections seem to be
these: <em>Glenalvon's</em> character is too abandoned. Such a man is
scarce in nature; at least it is inartificial in a poet to
suppose such a one, as if he could not conduct his fable by
the ordinary passions, infirmities, and vices of human nature.
<em>Lord Barnet's</em><a name="FNanchor_419:1_275" id="FNanchor_419:1_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_419:1_275" class="fnanchor">[419:1]</a> character is not enough decided; he
hovers betwixt vice and virtue; which, though it be not
unnatural, is not sufficiently theatrical nor tragic. After
<em>Anna</em> had lived eighteen years with <em>Lady Barnet</em>, and yet
had been kept out of the secret, there seems to be no
sufficient reason why, at that very time, she should have been
let into it. The spectator is apt to suspect that it was in
order to instruct him; a very good end, indeed, but which
might have been attained by a careful and artificial conduct
of the dialogue.</p>

<p><!-- Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_420" id="Page_v1_420">[420]</a></span>"There seem to be too many casual rencounters. <em>Young
Forman</em><a name="FNanchor_420:1_276" id="FNanchor_420:1_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:1_276" class="fnanchor">[420:1]</a> passing by chance, saves <em>Lord Barnet</em>; <em>Old
Forman</em>, passing that way, by chance, is arrested. Why might
not <em>Young Forman</em> be supposed to be coming to the castle, in
order to serve under <em>Lord Barnet</em>, and <em>Old Forman</em>, having
had some hint of his intention, to have followed him that way?</p>

<p class="center">[Some lines torn off and lost.]</p>

<p>Might not <em>Anna</em> be supposed to have returned to her mistress
after long absence? This might account for a greater flow of
confidence."<a name="FNanchor_420:2_277" id="FNanchor_420:2_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_420:2_277" class="fnanchor">[420:2]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 12th June, 1755.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I give you a great many thanks for thinking of me
in your project of a weekly paper. I approve very much of the
design, as you explain it to me; and there is nobody I would
more willingly engage with. But, as I have another work in
hand, which requires great labour and care to finish, I cannot
think of entering on a new undertaking, till I have brought
this to a conclusion. Your scheme would require me immediately
to remove to London; and I live here, at present, in great
tranquillity, with all my books around me; and I cannot think
of changing while I have so great a work in hand as the
finishing of my History.</p>

<p>"There are four short Dissertations, which I have kept some
years by me, in order to polish them as much as possible. One
of them is that which Allan Ramsay mentioned to you. Another,
of the Passions; a third, of Tragedy; a fourth, some
Considerations previous to Geometry and Natural
Philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_421:1_278" id="FNanchor_421:1_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_421:1_278" class="fnanchor">[421:1]</a> The whole, I think, would make a volume, a
fourth less than my Inquiry, as nearly as I can calculate; but
it would be proper to print it in a larger type, in order to
bring it to the same size and price. I would have <!-- Page 422 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_422" id="Page_v1_422">[422]</a></span>it
published about the new year; and I offer you the property for
fifty guineas, payable at the publication. You may judge, by
my being so moderate in my demands, that I do not propose to
make any words about the bargain. It would be more convenient
for me to print here, especially one of the Dissertations,
where there is a good deal of literature; but, as the
manuscript is distinct and accurate, it would not be
impossible for me to correct it, though printed at London. I
leave it to your choice; though I believe that it might be as
cheaply and conveniently and safely executed here. However,
the matter is pretty near indifferent to me. I would fain
prognosticate better than you say with regard to my History;
that you expect little sale till the publication of the second
volume. I hope the prejudices will dissipate sooner. I am,"

<p>In 1755, an effort was made to establish a periodical Review in
Scotland, characterized by a higher literary spirit, and a more original
tone of thinking, than the other periodical literature of the day could
boast. It assumed the name, so famous in later times, of <cite>The Edinburgh
Review</cite>. With such contributors as Smith, Robertson, Blair, and Jardine,
it could not fail to achieve its object, so far as its own merit was
concerned; but the public did not appreciate its excellence, and it died
after two half-yearly numbers, which may now be found on the shelves of
the curious. On this matter, Mackenzie says,</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">

<p>David Hume was not among the number of the writers of the
<cite>Review</cite>, though we should have thought he would have been the
first person whose co-operation they would have <!-- Page 423 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_423" id="Page_v1_423">[423]</a></span>sought. But I
think I have heard that they were afraid both of his extreme
good nature, and his extreme artlessness; that, from the one,
their criticisms would have been weakened or suppressed; and,
from the other, their secret discovered. The merits of the
work strongly attracted his attention, and he expressed his
surprise, to some of the gentlemen concerned in it, with whom
he was daily in the habit of meeting, at the excellence of a
performance written, as he presumed, from his ignorance on the
subject, by some persons out of their own literary circle. It
was agreed to communicate the secret to him at a dinner, which
was shortly after given by one of their number. At that dinner
he repeated his wonder on the subject of <cite>The Edinburgh
Review</cite>. One of the company said he knew the authors, and
would tell them to Mr. Hume upon his giving an oath of
secrecy. "How is the oath to be taken," said David, with his
usual pleasantry, "of a man accused of so much scepticism as I
am? You would not trust my Bible oath; but I will swear by the
<ins class="greek" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="to kalon">το καλον</ins> and the <ins class="greek" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="to prepon">το πρεπον</ins> never to reveal
your secret." He was then told the names of the authors and
the plan of the work; but it was not continued long enough to
allow of his contributing any articles.<a name="FNanchor_423:1_280" id="FNanchor_423:1_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_423:1_280" class="fnanchor">[423:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was a strong judgment to pass on a man who filled the office of
secretary of legation, and under-secretary of state, that a secret was
not safe in his keeping. Perhaps Hume had acquired absent habits about
trifles. But he could transact important business with ability, and keep
important secrets with strictness. There is a general propensity to
find, in the nature and habits of abstruse thinkers, an innocent
simplicity about the passing affairs of the world, which is often
dispelled by a nearer view of their characters. Hume was careless about
small matters; but in the serious transactions of life, he was
sagacious, prompt, and energetic. Though he did not <!-- Page 424 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_424" id="Page_v1_424">[424]</a></span>contribute to it,
he owed some substantial services to this periodical, in the conflict in
the ecclesiastical courts, which, in the course of events, comes now to
be considered.<a name="FNanchor_424:1_281" id="FNanchor_424:1_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_424:1_281" class="fnanchor">[424:1]</a></p>

<p>Hume was not one of those who, when they find that the opinions they
have formed are at variance with those of the rest of mankind, blaze the
unpopular portions forth in the light of day, or fling them in the face
of their adversaries. Among his intimate friends, he could pass sly
jests about his opinions; using, in regard to them, those strong
expressions which he knew his adversaries would apply to them. But he
disliked ostentation of any kind. He particularly <!-- Page 425 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_425" id="Page_v1_425">[425]</a></span>disliked the
ostentation of singularity; and so little was he aware that he was
outraging any of the world's opinions, in promulgating the fruits of his
metaphysical speculations, that he appears to have been much astonished
that any one should find in them any ground for serious objection, and
to have marvelled greatly that clergymen and others should deem him an
unfit person to be a professor of moral philosophy, or a teacher of
youth. "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rara temporum felicitas, ubi sentire quæ velis, et quæ sentias
dicere, licet</span>," was the motto of his first work; and he seems to have
thought that he lived in an age when speculation might soar with
unclipped wings, and when his opinions would be questioned only before
the tribunal of reason.</p>

<p>In all this, however, he now found that he was mistaken, and that there
were persons who, professing to have charge of these matters, and to
know the final judgment concerning them, thought right to execute it on
earth, by punishing the man whose opinions were different from their
own. The soul of this crusade was a certain Reverend George Anderson, a
restless, fiery, persevering being, probably of great polemical note in
his day, the observed of all observers as he passed through the city, a
Boanerges in church courts; but now only known through the eminence of
those against whom the fury of his zeal was directed. Hume was not the
only object of pursuit. Other game was started at the same time in the
person of his friend, Lord Kames. It is somewhat remarkable, that it was
against the latter that the pursuit was most persevering and bitter. He
was certainly not a man likely to have provoked such attacks. It is true
that he meddled with dangerous subjects, but he did so with great
caution and skill. Bred to the practice of the bar, at a time when the
<!-- Page 426 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_426" id="Page_v1_426">[426]</a></span>advocate often felt a temptation to insinuate doctrines which could not
be proclaimed without risk, he became like a chemist who is expert in
the safe manipulation of detonating materials. Yet he made a narrow
escape; for as he had been raised to the bench in 1752, any proceeding
by a church court, professing to subject him to punishment, temporal or
eternal, however lightly it might have fallen on a philosopher, might
have tended materially to injure the usefulness of a judge.</p>

<p>Kames' work, which was published in 1751, and entitled "Essays on the
Principles of Morality and Natural Religion," bears evident marks of
having been written in opposition to the opinions laid down by Hume,
although the author probably did not wish to expose the works of his
kind friend to odium, by making a particular reference to them. It is
clear that he considered his own opinions likely to be so very popular
among the orthodox, that it would be doing an evil turn to his friend,
to mention him as the promulgator of views on the other side. In his
advertisement, he said, the object of his book was "to prepare the way
for a proof of the existence of the Deity," and the Essays end with a
prayer. Their leading principle is, that according to the doctrine of
predestination, there can be no liberty to human beings, in the ordinary
acceptation of the term, while the Deity has nevertheless, for wise
purposes, which we cannot fathom, implanted in our race the feeling that
we are free. Some have held that, while the scheme of predestination was
exhibited by Hume as a mere metaphysical theory, Kames united it to
vital religion. He had the misfortune, however, to write in a
philosophical tone; and those who constituted themselves judges of the
matter, seem to have taken example <!-- Page 427 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_427" id="Page_v1_427">[427]</a></span>from the stern father, who, when
there is a quarrel in the nursery, punishes both sides, because
quarrelling is a thing not allowed in the house. In a letter to Michael
Ramsay, Hume says, in continuation of a passage printed above,<a name="FNanchor_427:1_282" id="FNanchor_427:1_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_427:1_282" class="fnanchor">[427:1]</a>
"Have you seen our friend Harry's Essays? They are well wrote, and are
an unusual instance of an obliging method of answering a book.
Philosophers must judge of the question; but the clergy have already
decided it, and say he is as bad as me! Nay, some affirm him to be
worse,&mdash;as much as a treacherous friend is worse than an open enemy."
Dr. Blair is believed to have been the champion of Kames; and the
following notice of his connexion with the controversy, given by
Mackenzie, is valuable and instructive.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p><a name="bq_p427" id="bq_p427"></a>It is a singular enough coincidence with some church
proceedings, about fifty years after,<a name="FNanchor_427:2_283" id="FNanchor_427:2_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_427:2_283" class="fnanchor">[427:2]</a> that Dr. Blair,
in defence of his friend's Essays, expressly states, that one
purpose of those Essays was to controvert what appeared to him
to be a very dangerous doctrine, held by the author of certain
other <cite>Essays</cite>, then recently published, (by Mr. David Hume,)
that, by no principle in human nature, can we discover any
real connexion between <em>cause</em> and <em>effect</em>. According to Dr.
Blair, the object of one of Lord Kames' Essays is to show,
that though such connexion is not discoverable by <em>reason</em>,
and by a process of argumentative induction, there is,
nevertheless, a real and obvious connexion, which every one
intuitively perceives between an <em>effect</em> and its <em>cause</em>. We
feel and acknowledge, that every effect implies a cause; that
nothing can begin to exist without a cause of its existence.
"We are not left," says the author of the Vindication, "to
gather our belief of a <em>Deity</em>, from inferences and
conclusions deduced through intermediate steps, many or few.
How unhappy would it be, for the great bulk of mankind, if
this were necessary!"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><!-- Page 428 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_428" id="Page_v1_428">[428]</a></span>The first attack was made in a pamphlet, called "An Estimate of the
Profit and Loss of Religion, personally and publicly stated: illustrated
with reference to 'Essays on Morality and Natural Religion,'" published
at Edinburgh, in 1753; the work of Anderson himself, and endowed with
all the marks of its author. This was levelled against Kames alone; but
it was followed in 1755 by a pamphlet, in which, under the name of
Sopho, he was coupled with Hume, thus: "An Analysis of the Moral and
Religious Sentiments contained in the Writings of Sopho and David Hume,
Esq., addressed to the consideration of the reverend and honourable
members of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland." "My design,"
says the author, "is to analyze the works of these celebrated authors,
giving their own expressions under the different heads to which they
seem to belong. This method, I imagine, will not only give the clearest
view of the sentiments of these gentlemen, but is such as they
themselves must allow to be the most fair and candid; because if, in
stating the proposition, I should happen to mistake their meaning, their
own words, subjoined, must immediately do them justice." With this
preamble, the writer ranges his quotations under such heads as, "All
distinction betwixt virtue and vice is merely imaginary;" "Adultery is
very lawful, but sometimes not expedient," &amp;c.</p>

<p>A counter pamphlet was published, called "Observations upon a pamphlet,
entitled 'An Analysis of the Moral and Religious Sentiments contained in
the Writings of Sopho and David Hume, Esq.'"<a name="FNanchor_428:1_284" id="FNanchor_428:1_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_428:1_284" class="fnanchor">[428:1]</a> In reference to his
opponents' boasted series of accurate quotations, the writer of this
answer says, "If there <!-- Page 429 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_429" id="Page_v1_429">[429]</a></span>should be found passages which are neither the
words nor the meaning of the author, the falsehood cannot be palliated
nor excused." And then, after giving a specimen of these "accurate"
quotations, he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>"In all that page there is no such sentence, neither is there
any such sentiment to be found. The passage from the beginning
is as follows," &amp;c. and he continues: "To glean disunited
sentences, to patch them together arbitrarily, to omit the
limitations or remarks with which a proposition is delivered;
can this be styled exhibiting the sentiments of an author? I
hope I shall not be thought to deviate into any thing
ludicrous, when I refer the reader to a well-known treatise of
the Dean of St. Patrick's, in which the inquisitorial method
of interpretation in the Church of Rome is by so just and so
severe raillery rendered detestable. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si non totidem
sententiis, ast totidem verbis; si non totidem verbis, ast
totidem syllabis; si non totidem syllabis ast totidem
literis.</i> This is the genuine logic of persecution."<a name="FNanchor_429:1_285" id="FNanchor_429:1_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_429:1_285" class="fnanchor">[429:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The matter was brought before the immediately ensuing General Assembly,
that of 1755; by which a general resolution was passed, expressive of
the Church's "utmost abhorrence" of "impious and infidel principles,"
and of "the deepest concern on account of the prevalence of infidelity
and immorality, the <!-- Page 430 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_430" id="Page_v1_430">[430]</a></span>principles whereof have been, to the disgrace of
our age and nation, so openly avowed in several books published of late
in this country, and which are but too well known amongst us." But this
general anathema was not sufficient to satisfy the pious zeal of Mr.
Anderson, who, in anticipation of the meeting of the Assembly in 1756,
wrote another pamphlet, called "Infidelity a proper object of censure."</p>

<p>The initiatory step in the legislative business of the General Assembly,
is the bringing before it an overture, which has previously obtained the
sanction, either of one of the inferior church courts, or of a committee
of the Assembly for preparing overtures. In such a committee, it was
moved on 28th May, 1756, that the following overture should be
transmitted to the Assembly.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>"The General Assembly, judging it their duty to do all in
their power to check the growth and progress of infidelity;
and considering, that as infidel writings have begun of late
years to be published in this nation, against which they have
hitherto only testified in general, so there is one person
styling himself David Hume, Esq. who hath arrived at such a
degree of boldness as publicly to avow himself the author of
books containing the most rude and open attacks upon the
glorious gospel of Christ, and principles evidently subversive
even of natural religion, and the foundations of morality, if
not establishing direct atheism: therefore the Assembly
appoint the following persons&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a committee to inquire
into the writings of this author, to call him before them, and
prepare the matter for the next General Assembly."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The matter was discussed with the usual keenness of such debates in such
bodies. But toleration was triumphant, and the overture was rejected by
fifty votes to seventeen.<a name="FNanchor_430:1_286" id="FNanchor_430:1_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_430:1_286" class="fnanchor">[430:1]</a></p>

<p>Still the indefatigable Anderson returned to the <!-- Page 431 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_431" id="Page_v1_431">[431]</a></span>charge, though he
brought it against humbler persons in a less conspicuous arena. As he
found the authors above his reach, he resolved to proceed against the
booksellers; and he brought before the Presbytery of Edinburgh a
"Petition and Complaint" against Alexander Kincaid and Alexander
Donaldson, the <!-- Page 432 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_432" id="Page_v1_432">[432]</a></span>publishers of "Kames' Essays," praying, "that the said
printer and booksellers may be summoned to the next meeting of the
Presbytery, and there and then to declare and give up the author of the
said book; and that he and they may be censured, according to the law of
the gospel, and the practice of this and all other well-governed
churches." Anderson indeed would seem to have imbibed the spirit of the
great Anthony Arnauld: who, when Nicole spoke of some rest from the
endless war of polemical controversy, exclaimed, "Rest! will you not
have enough of rest hereafter, through all eternity?" Before the
Presbytery could meet he accordingly published another pamphlet, called
"the Complaint of George Anderson, minister of the gospel, verified by
passages in the book libelled." He died in the 19th October,<a name="FNanchor_432:1_287" id="FNanchor_432:1_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_432:1_287" class="fnanchor">[432:1]</a> just
ten days before the meeting of the presbytery, for which he had made
such active preparation. He fell in harness, and the departure of the
restless spirit of the champion from its tenement of clay, was death to
the cause. After the perusal of written pleadings, and a formal debate,
the complaint was dismissed.</p>

<p>This matter appears to have given Hume very little disturbance. He does
not mention it in his "own life." He laboured uninterruptedly at the
second volume of his History; and his correspondence, which we may now
resume, will be found to pursue its even tenor, taking no farther notice
of the proceedings of his opponents, than the simple question put to
Smith, whether it will be a matter of much consequence if he should be
excommunicated?</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><!-- Page 433 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_433" id="Page_v1_433">[433]</a></span><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Clephane</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 20th April, 1756.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;There is certainly nothing so unaccountable as
my long silence with you; that is, with a man whose friendship
I desire most to preserve of any I know, and whose
conversation I would be the most covetous to enjoy, were I in
the same place with him. But to tell the truth, we people in
the country, (for such you Londoners esteem our city,) are apt
to be troublesome to you people in town; we are vastly glad to
receive letters which convey intelligence to us of things
which we should otherwise have been ignorant of, and can pay
them back with nothing but provincial stories, which are no
way interesting. It was perhaps an apprehension of this kind
which held my pen: but really, I believe, the truth is, when I
was idle, I was lazy&mdash;when I was busy, I was so extremely
busy, that I had no leisure to think of any thing else. For,
dear Doctor, what have we to do with news on either side,
unless it be literary news, which I hope will always interest
us? and of these, London seems to me as barren as Edinburgh;
or rather more so, since I can tell you that our friend Hume's
'Douglas,' is altered and finished, and will be brought out on
the stage next winter, and is a singular, as well as fine
performance, [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="FNanchor_433:1_288" id="FNanchor_433:1_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_433:1_288" class="fnanchor">[433:1]</a>] of the spirit of the English
theatre, not devoid of Attic and French elegance. You have
sent us nothing worth reading this winter; even your vein of
wretched novels is dried up, though not that of scurrilous
partial politics. We hear of Sir George Lyttleton's History,
from which the populace expect a great deal: but I <!-- Page 434 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_434" id="Page_v1_434">[434]</a></span>hear it is
to be three quarto volumes. '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O, magnum horribilem et sacrum
Libellum</span>.'&mdash;This last epithet of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacrum</i> will probably be
applicable to it in more senses than one. However, it cannot
well fail to be readable, which is a great deal for an English
book now-a-days.</p>

<p>"But, dear Doctor, even places more hyperborean than this,
more provincial, more uncultivated, and more barbarous, may
furnish articles for a literary correspondence. Have you seen
the second volume of Blackwell's 'Court of Augustus?' I had it
some days lying on my table, and, on turning it over, met with
passages very singular for their ridicule and absurdity. He
says that Mark Antony, travelling from Rome in a post-chaise,
lay the first night at Redstones: I own I did not think this a
very classical name; but, on recollection, I found, by the
Philippics, that he lay at Saxa Rubra. He talks also of Mark
Antony's favourite poet, Mr. Gosling, meaning Anser, who,
methinks, should rather be called Mr. Goose. He also takes
notice of Virgil's distinguishing himself, in his youth, by
his epigram on Crossbow the robber! Look your Virgil, you'll
find that, like other robbers, this man bore various names.
Crossbow is the name he took at Aberdeen, but Balista at Rome.
The book has many other flowers<a name="FNanchor_434:1_289" id="FNanchor_434:1_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_434:1_289" class="fnanchor">[434:1]</a> <!-- Page 435 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_435" id="Page_v1_435">[435]</a></span>of a like nature,
which made me exclaim, with regard to the author,</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Nec <em>certe</em><a name="FNanchor_435:1_290" id="FNanchor_435:1_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_435:1_290" class="fnanchor">[435:1]</a> apparet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. utrum</div>
    <div class="line">Minxerit in patrios cineres, an triste bidental</div>
    <div class="line">Moverit incestus. Certe furit.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But other people, who have read through the volume, say that,
notwithstanding these absurdities, it does not want merit;
and, if it be so, I own the case is still more singular. What
would you think of a man who should speak of the mayorality of
Mr. Veitch; meaning the consulship of Cicero?&mdash;Is not this a
fine way of avoiding the imputation of pedantry? Perhaps
Cicero, to modernize him entirely, should be called Sir Mark
Veitch, because his father was a Roman knight.</p>

<p>"I do not find your name among the subscribers of my friend
Blacklock's poems, you have forgot; buy a copy of them and
read them, they are many of them very elegant, and merit
esteem, if they came from any one, but are admirable from him.
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="FNanchor_435:2_291" id="FNanchor_435:2_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_435:2_291" class="fnanchor">[435:2]</a>] Spence's industry in so good a work, but there
is a circumstance of his conduct that will entertain you. In
the Edinburgh edition there was a stanza to this effect:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">The wise in every age conclude,</div>
    <div class="line">What Pyrrho taught and Hume renewed,</div>
    <div class="line i1">That Dogmatists are fools.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Mr. Spence would not undertake to promote a London
subscription, unless my name, as well as Lord Shaftesbury's,
(who was mentioned in another place,) were erased: the author
frankly gave up Shaftesbury, but said that he would forfeit
all the profit he might <!-- Page 436 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_436" id="Page_v1_436">[436]</a></span>expect from a subscription, rather
than relinquish the small tribute of praise which he had paid
to a man whom he was more indebted to than to all the world
beside. I heard by chance of this controversy, and wrote to
Mr. Spence, that, without farther consulting the author, I,
who was chiefly concerned, would take upon me to empower him
to alter the stanza where I was mentioned. He did so, and
farther, having prefixed the life of the author, he took
occasion to mention some people to whom he had been obliged,
but is careful not to name me; judging rightly that such good
deeds were only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">splendida peccata</i>, and that till they were
sanctified by the grace of God they would be of no benefit to
salvation.<a name="FNanchor_436:1_292" id="FNanchor_436:1_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_436:1_292" class="fnanchor">[436:1]</a></p>

<p>"I have seen (but, I thank God, was not bound to read) Dr.

compliments to him, and tell him, that I am his most obliged
humble servant. I hope you understand that the last clause was
spoken ironically. You would have surprised <em>him</em> very much
had you executed the compliment. I shall conclude this article
of literature by mentioning myself. I have finished the second
volume of my History, and have maintained the same unbounded
liberty in my politics which gave so much offence: religion

"It gives me great affliction, dear Doctor, when you speak of
gouts and old age. Alas! you are going down hill, and I am
tumbling fast after you. I have, however, very entire health,
notwithstanding my studious sedentary life. I only grow fat
more than I could wish. When shall I see you? God knows. I am
settled here; have no pretensions, nor hopes, nor desires, to
carry me to court the great. I live frugally on a small
fortune, which I care not to dissipate by jaunts of pleasure.
All these circumstances give me little prospect of seeing
London. Were I to change my habitation, I would retire to some
provincial town in France, to trifle out my old age, near a
warm sun in a good climate, a pleasant country, and amidst a
sociable people. My stock would then maintain me in some
opulence; for I have the satisfaction to tell you, dear
Doctor, that on reviewing my affairs, I find that I am worth
£1600 sterling, which, at five per cent, makes near 1800
livres a-year&mdash;that is, the pay of two French captains.</p>

<p>"Edmonstone left this town for Ireland. I wish he were out of
the way: he has no prospect of advancement suitable to his

dignified member of their own body, viz. Mr. Kenneth Mackenzie,
Advocate, Professor of the Civil Law in the University of Edinburgh,
should be named to that office, and others inclining that Mr. David Hume
should be elected, it was agreed that the matter should be put to a

latter; upon which, the Dean and Faculty declared the said Mr. David

records, under his custody, they appointed him also clerk to the
Faculty, which office had been lately resigned by Mr. David Falconer,
with power to the said Mr. Hume to officiate therein by a depute.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gilbert Elliot, senior, curator of the library, here proposed, that
in consideration that there would be a good deal of labour and trouble
in delivering over the library to Mr. Hume, and his receiving the same,
and doing several other things requisite and necessary relating thereto,
that the Faculty should name a certain salary to some person as under
keeper for some time till that business may be accomplished. The Dean
and Faculty resolved, that they would name no person, nor no salary, but
leave Mr. Hume, their library keeper, himself the nomination and choice
of his own depute, as he was to be answerable and accountable to the
Faculty for his whole charge and intromissions; but that, against the
next anniversary meeting, they would take under their consideration what
extraordinary work should be then accomplished, and do therein as should
be found reasonable.</p>

<p>"Lastly, the Dean and Faculty appointed Mr. George Brown to intimate to
Mr. David Hume their election of him for their library keeper, and that
he should be present at their next meeting to have the oath <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de fideli</i>
administered to him."</p>

<p>In this office, Hume succeeded the celebrated Thomas Ruddiman. The life
of this distinguished critic and philologist was written in an 8vo
volume by George Chalmers, (1794.) This book is valuable as containing
some of the finest specimens of mixed bombast and bathos in the English
language. Chalmers was a distinguished antiquary, and his high fame in
that department of research was well earned; but this did not content
his ambition, and like an eminent Anglo-Saxon antiquary of the present
day, he must needs mount a cap and bells on his head, by aping the style
of the fine writers of his age. Gibbon and Johnson seem to have been
honoured with an equal share in the elements of his style. He can say
nothing without a due pomp and state; when he tells us how John Love was
the son of a bookseller in Dumbarton, he must put it thus: "He was born
in July, 1695, at Dunbarton, the Dunbriton of the British, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arx
Britonum</i> of the Romans, the Dunclidon of Ravennas, the Alcluyd of Bede,
and he was the son of John Love, a bookseller, who, like greater dealers
in greater towns, supplied his customers with such books as their taste
required, and, like the father of Johnson, occasionally exhibited his
books at the neighbouring fairs." We are then of course provided with a
list of what these books sold by Love's father might or might not
probably be, which has this reference to the life of Ruddiman, that
<em>young</em> Love quarrelled with him. We then find such solemn announcements
as the following: "Love had scarcely animadverted on Trotter, when he
was carried before the judicatories of the kirk by Mr. Sydserf, the
minister of Dumbarton, who accused him of <em>brewing on a Sunday</em>; and
who, after a juridical trial, was obliged to make a public apology for
having maliciously accused calumniated innocence." A printer publishing
books calculated for an extensive sale is thus described:&mdash;"To these
other qualities of prudence, of industry, and of attention, Ruddiman
added judgment. He did not print splendid editions of books for the
public good; he did not publish volumes for the perusal of the few; but
he chiefly employed his press in supplying Scotland with books, which,
from their daily use, had a general sale; and he was by this motive
induced to furnish country shopkeepers with school-books at the lowest
rate."</p>

at by consulting the first volume of the catalogue, printed under
Ruddiman's auspices in 1742, folio. It is a singular circumstance that
this library has always been very deficient in the early editions of
Hume's works&mdash;those which were published before his librarianship.
Another set of works, which one misses in the early catalogues, consists
in the controversial books, written by Logan <em>against</em> its previous
librarian, Ruddiman.</p>

pleasure of the Faculty, according to the above minute, was Walter
Goodall, an unfortunate scholar, whom Hume's predecessor in office, the
celebrated Thomas Ruddiman, had attached to the library as a hanger-on
and miscellaneous drudge. The extent of his emoluments may be
appreciated from a minute of Faculty, (7th Jan. 1758,) which, in
consideration of his long services, awards him a salary of "£5 a-year,
over and above what he may receive from the keeper of the library."
Goodall's character and fate are summed up in the sententious remark of
Lord Hailes, that "Walter was seldom sober." Yet he did not a little for
historical literature. He was a violent Jacobite and champion of the
innocence of Queen Mary; and in 1754 he published, in two volumes 8vo,
his "Examination of the Letters said to be written by Mary, Queen of
Scots, to James, Earl of Bothwell, showing by intrinsick and extrinsick
evidence that they are forgeries." In 1759 he edited the best edition of
Fordun's Scotichronicon, in two volumes folio.</p>

<p>The following traditional anecdote has been preserved, of the keeper and
his assistant. "One day, while Goodall was composing his treatise
concerning Queen Mary, he became drowsy, and laying down his head upon
his MSS. in that posture fell asleep. Hume entering the library, and
finding the controversialist in that position, stepped softly up to him,
and laying his mouth to Watty's ear, roared out with the voice of a
stentor, that Queen Mary was a whore and had murdered her husband.
Watty, not knowing whether it was a dream or a real adventure, or
whether the voice proceeded from a ghost or a living creature, started
up, and before he was awake or his eyes well opened, he sprang upon
Hume, and seizing him by the throat, pushed him to the farther end of
the library, exclaiming all the while that he was some base Presbyterian
parson, who was come to murder the character of Queen Mary, as his
predecessors had contributed to murder her person. Hume used to tell
this story with much glee, and Watty acknowledged the truth of it with
much frankness." Chambers's Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen,

that Lord Charlemont must have constructed the following romantic story
of Hume. "He was tender-hearted, friendly, and charitable in the
extreme, as will appear from a fact, which I have from good authority.
When a member of the University of Edinburgh, and in great want of
money, having little or no paternal fortune, and the collegiate stipend
being very inconsiderable, he had procured, through the interest of some
friend, an office in the university, which was worth about £40 a-year.
On the day when he had received this good news, and just when he had got
into his possession the patent or grant entitling him to his office, he
was visited by his friend Blacklock, the poet, who is much better known
by his poverty and blindness than by his genius. This poor man began a
long descant on his misery, bewailing his want of sight, his large
family of children, and his utter inability to provide for them, or even
procure them the necessaries of life. Hume, unable to bear his
complaints, and destitute of money to assist him, ran instantly to his
desk, took out the grant, and presented it to his miserable friend, who
received it with exultation, and whose name was soon after, by Hume's
interest, inserted instead of his own."&mdash;<cite>Hardy's Memoirs of
Charlemont</cite>, p. 9. This story is constructed after the received model of
the current anecdotes of Fielding, Goldsmith, and others, and is perhaps
as close to the truth as many of them would be found to be, if they were
minutely investigated. It is pretty clear that Hume's generosity,&mdash;for
generosity he certainly had, to a very large extent, by the testimony of
all who knew him,&mdash;was not so much the creature of impulse, as that of
the authors who have been mentioned above: but such an instance as that
just given, is a warning to distrust those anecdotes of the
inconsiderate generosity of men of genius, that are put into a very
dramatic shape.</p>

the Faculty and their curators, owing to the arbitrary disposal of the
books by the latter. On 6th January it was represented by Mr. William
Johnstone, that the curators had ordered certain books to be sold, and
that the practice was a very questionable one, "seeing as one curator
succeeded another yearly, and different men had different tastes, the
library might by that means happen to suffer considerably." It was
declared that the curators had no right to dispose of books.</p>

well-known author of the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Chevalier des Grieux et de Manon
Lescaut</span>," which still holds its place in French popular literature,
though it bears but a small proportion to the bulk of his other
voluminous works which are forgotten. The authors of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire

un style souvent embarrassé, sémé d'Anglicismes, d'expressions peu
Françoises, de tours durs, de phrases louches et mal construites</span>." This
abbé led an irregular life, being a sort of disgraced ecclesiastic, and
his death was singularly tragical. He had fallen by the side of a wood
in a fit of apoplexy. Being found insensible, he was removed as a dead
body to the residence of a magistrate, where a surgeon was to open the
body to discover the cause of death. At the first insertion of the
knife, a scream from the victim terrified all present: but it was too
late; the instrument had entered a vital part.</p>

Crawford and Balcarres, by Lord Lindsay." Hume's correspondent was
James, the fifth earl. He had had the misfortune to be "out in the
fifteen," and though a zealous and hardy soldier, he in vain attempted
to rise in the army; and at last retiring in disgust, he betook himself
to learned leisure. In the pleasing work above referred to, he is thus
picturesquely described: "Though his aspect was noble, and his air and
deportment showed him at once a man of rank, yet there was no denying
that a degree of singularity attended his appearance. To his large
brigadier wig, which hung down with three tails, he generally added a
few curls of his own application, which I suspect would not have been
considered quite orthodox by the trade. His shoe, which resembled
nothing so much as a little boat with a cabin at the end of it, was
slashed with his pen-knife, for the benefit of giving ease to his honest
toes; here&mdash;there&mdash;he slashed it where he chose to slash, without an
idea that the world or its fashions had the smallest right to smile at
his shoe; had they smiled, he would have smiled too, and probably said,
'Odsfish! I believe it is not like other people's; but as to that, look,

<p>The following paper made its first appearance in <cite>The Edinburgh Weekly
Chronicle</cite>, a few years ago, when it was edited by Mr. Hislop, a
gentleman said to be well acquainted with theatrical matters. It is here
repeated, not as being believed, but because having excited some
attention when it first appeared, it found its way into some books
connected with Scottish literature.</p>

<p>"It may not be generally known, that the first rehearsal took place in
the lodgings in the Canongate, occupied by Mrs. Sarah Warde, one of
Digges's company; and that it was rehearsed by, and in presence of the
most distinguished literary characters Scotland ever could boast of. The
following was the cast of the piece on the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The audience that day, besides Mr. Digges, and Mrs. Warde, were, the

Monboddo, (the two last were then only lawyers,) the Rev. John Steele
and William Home, ministers. The company, all but Mrs. Warde, dined
afterwards in the Erskine Club, in the Abbey."</p>

<p>The reader must take this statement at its own value, which he will
probably not consider high. The "cast," has no pretensions to be a
transcript of any contemporary document; for Dr. Robertson was not then
Principal of the University, but minister of the country parish of
Gladsmuir; and Ferguson was not a Professor, but an army chaplain, with
leave of absence, spending his time chiefly in Perthshire. Lord Kames,
spoken of as "only" a lawyer, had been raised to the bench in 1752.</p>

this periodical has some connexion. Dr. Walter Anderson, minister of
Chirnside, having caught the fire of literary ambition, made the remark
to Hume, one afternoon when they had been enjoying the hospitalities of
Ninewells: "Mr. David, I daresay other people might write books too; but
you clever fellows have taken up all the good subjects. When I look
about me, I cannot find one unoccupied."&mdash;"What would you think, Mr.
Anderson," said Hume, in reply, "of a History of Crœsus, king of
Lydia? This has never yet been written." Dr. Anderson was a man who
understood no jesting, and held no words as uttered in vain; so away he
goes, pulls down his Herodotus, and translates all the passages in the
first book relating to Crœsus, with all the consultations of the
oracles, and all the dreams; only interweaving with them, from his own
particular genius, some very sage and lengthy remarks on the extent to
which there was real truth in the prophetic revelations of the
Pythoness. This book, which is now a great rarity, was reviewed with
much gravity and kindness in <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite>. It was more
severely treated in <cite>The Critical Review</cite>, edited by Smollett, where it
is said, "There is still a race of soothsayers in the Highlands,
derived, if we may believe some curious antiquaries, from the Druids and
Bards that were set apart for the worship of Apollo. The author of the
History before us may, for aught we know, be one of these venerable
seers, though we rather take him to be a Presbyterian teacher, who has
been used to expound apothegms that need no explanation."</p>

have called forth some blasts of the trumpet, still better suited to

Death-bed, or a lively Portraiture of a Dying Infidel." The contemporary
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, which carried on a guerilla warfare on the side of
the threatened philosophers, thus commences a notice of this production.
"This is a most extraordinary performance. The hero of it is an infidel,
'a humorous youth,' as the author describes him, 'a youth whose life was
one successive scene of pleasantry and humour: who laughed at
revelation, and called religion <em>priestcraft</em> and <em>grimace</em>: a gay and
sprightly free-thinker. But yesterday,' says he 'this gay and sprightly
free-thinker <em>revelled</em> his usual <em>round</em> of gallantry and applause,
till, satiated at length, he staggered to bed devoid of sense and
reason.' We suppose, (continues the reviewer,) the author's meaning is,
that he went to bed very drunk.'"</p>

are partial to such reading, will find a pretty clear abstract of the
debate. The General Assembly had its hands at that time pretty full. A
deadly dispute had arisen between the partisans of the old and new
church music, which is thus described in Ritchie's Life of Hume, p. 57:</p>

<p>"At this time the Scottish church was thrown into a general ferment by
an attempt to introduce the reformed music. In accomplishing this, the
most indecent scenes were exhibited. It was not uncommon for a
congregation to divide themselves into two parties, one of which, in
chaunting the psalms, followed the old, and the other the new mode of
musical execution; while the infidel, who was not in the habit of
frequenting the temple, now resorted to it, not for the laudable purpose
of repentance and edification, but from the ungodly motive of being a
spectator of the contest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"During the present dispute, it was customary for the partisans of the
different kinds of music to convene apart, in numerous bodies, for the
purpose of practising, and to muster their whole strength on the
Sabbath. The moment the psalm was read from the pulpit, each side, in
general chorus, commenced their operations; and as the pastor and clerk,
or precentor, often differed in their sentiments, the church was
immediately in an uproar. Blows and bruises were interchanged by the
impassioned songsters, and, in many parts of the country, the most
serious disturbances took place."</p>

<p>They had, at the same time, to conduct the war against the tragedy of
Douglas, and the frequenters of the theatre. Home himself, as is well
known, escaped the odium of ecclesiastical punishment, by resigning his
ministerial charge. Order was then taken with those clergy who could not
resist being present on so memorable an occasion as the performance of a
great national tragedy, written by a member of their own body. Among
these the Rev. Mr. White of Libberton was subjected to the modified
punishment of a month's suspension from office, because 'he had attended
the representation only once, when he endeavoured to conceal himself in
a corner, to avoid giving offence.' <cite>Scots Mag.</cite> for 1757, p. 47.</p>

year. One is tempted to say with Lady Macbeth, "Who would have thought
the old man had so much blood in him." Besides these conflicts in

AND THE CAUSES OF ITS FAILURE.</small><a name="FNanchor_441:1_295" id="FNanchor_441:1_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_441:1_295" class="fnanchor" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 50%;">[441:1]</a>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>The forces under Lieutenant General St. Clair consisted of five
battalions, viz. the first battalion of the 1st Royal, the 5th
Highlanders, 3d Brag's, 4th Richbell's, 2d Harrison's, together with
part of Frampton's, and some companies of Marines, making in all about
4500 men. The fleet consisted of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Though this
army and fleet had been at first fitted out for entering upon action in
summer 1746, and making conquest of Canada, it was found, after several
vain efforts to get out of the Channel, first under Commodore Cotes,
then under Admiral Listock, that so much time had been unavoidably lost,
from contrary winds and contrary orders, as to render it dangerous for
so large a body of ships to proceed thither. The middle of May was the
last day of rendezvous appointed at Spithead; and in the latter end of
August, the fleet had yet got no farther than St. Helen's, about a
league below it. It is an observation, that in the latter end of autumn,
or beginning of winter, the north-west winds blow so furiously on the
coast of North America, as to render it always difficult, and often
impossible, for ships that set out late to reach any harbour in those
parts. Instances have been found of vessels that have been obliged to
take shelter from these storms, even in the Leeward Islands. It was
therefore become necessary to abandon all thoughts of proceeding to
America that season; and as the transports were fitted out and fleet
equipped at great expense, an attempt was hastily made to turn them to
some account in Europe, during the small remainder of the summer. The
distress of the allies in Flanders demanded the more immediate attention
of the English nation and ministry, <!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_442" id="Page_v1_442">[442]</a></span>and required, if possible, some
speedy remedy. 'Twas too late to think of sending the six battalions
under General St. Clair, to reinforce Prince Charles of Lorraine, who
commanded the armies of the allies; and their number was, besides, too
inconsiderable to hope for any great advantages from that expedient.
'Twas more to be expected, that falling on the parts of France, supposed
to be defenceless and disarmed, they might make a diversion, and
occasion the sending a considerable detachment from the enemy's army in
Flanders. But as time pressed, and allowed not leisure to concert and
prepare this measure, the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State, hoped
to find that General St. Clair had already planned and projected some
enterprise of this nature. He formed this presumption on a hint which
had been started very casually, and which had been immediately dropped
by the General.</p>

<p>In the spring, when the obstructions and delays thrown in the way of the
American enterprise were partly felt and partly foreseen, the Secretary,
lamenting the great and, he feared, useless expense to which the nation
had been put by that undertaking, gave occasion to the General to throw
out a thought, which would naturally occur in such a situation. He said,
"Why may you not send the squadron and troops to some part of the coast
of France, and at least frighten and alarm them as they have done us;
and, as all their troops are on the Flanders and German frontiers, 'tis
most probable that such an alarm may make them recall some of them?" The
subject was then no farther prosecuted; but the King, being informed of
this casual hint of the General's, asked him if he had formed any plan
or project by which the service above-mentioned might be effectuated. He
assured his majesty that he had never so much as thought of it; but
that, if it was his pleasure, he would confer with Sir John Ligonier,
and endeavour to find other people in London who could let him into some
knowledge of the coast of France. To this the King replied, "No, no; you
need not give yourself any trouble about it." And accordingly the
General never more thought of it, farther than to inform the Duke of
Newcastle of this conference with his majesty. However, the Duke being
willing that the person who was to execute the undertaking should also
be the projector of it, by which means both greater success might be
hoped from it, and every body else be screened from reflection in case
of its miscarriage, desired, in his letter of the 22d of August, that
both the Admiral and General should give their opinion of such an
invasion; and particularly the General, who, having, he said, formed
some time ago a project of this nature, might be the better prepared to
give his thoughts with <!-- Page 443 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_443" id="Page_v1_443">[443]</a></span>regard to it. They both jointly replied, that
their utter ignorance made them incapable of delivering their sentiments
on so delicate a subject; and the General, in a separate letter,
recalled to the Duke's memory the circumstances of the story, as above
related.</p>

<p>Though they declined proposing a project, they both cheerfully offered,
that if his majesty would honour them with any plan of operation for a
descent, they would do their best to carry it into execution. They hoped
that the Secretary of State, who, by his office, is led to turn his eyes
every where, and who lives at London, the centre of commerce and
intelligence, could better form and digest such a plan, than they who
were cooped up in their ships, in a remote sea-port town, without any
former acquaintance with the coast of France, and without any
possibility of acquiring new knowledge. They at least hoped, that so
difficult a task would not be required of them as either to give their
sentiments without any materials afforded them to judge upon, or to
collect materials, while the most inviolable secrecy was strictly
enjoined on them. It is remarkable, that the Duke of Newcastle, among
other advantages proposed by this expedition, mentions the giving
assistance to such Protestants as are already in arms, or may be
disposed to rise on the appearance of the English, as if we were living
in the time of the League, or during the confusion of Francis the
Second's minority.</p>

<p>Full of these reflections, they sailed from St. Helens on the 23d of
August, and arrived at Plymouth on the 29th, in obedience to their
orders, which required them to put into that harbour for farther
instructions. They there found positive orders to sail immediately, with
the first fair wind, to the coast of France, and make an attempt on
L'Orient, or Rochefort, or Rochelle, or sail up the river of Bourdeaux;
or, if they judged any of these enterprises impracticable, to sail to
whatever other place on the western coast they should think proper. Such
unbounded discretionary powers could not but be agreeable to commanders,
had it been accompanied with better, or indeed with any intelligence. As
the wind was then contrary, they had leisure to reply in their letters
of the 29th and 30th. They jointly represented the difficulties, or
rather impossibilities, of any attempt on L'Orient, Rochefort, and
Rochelle, by reason of the real strength of these places, so far as
their imperfect information could reach; or, if that were erroneous, by
reason of their own absolute want of intelligence, guides, and pilots,
which are the soul of all military operations.</p>

<p>The General, in a separate letter, enforced the same topics, and added
many other reflections of moment. He said, that of all the <!-- Page 444 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_444" id="Page_v1_444">[444]</a></span>places
mentioned in his orders, Bourdeaux, if accessible, appeared to him the
properest to be attempted; both as it is one of the towns of greatest
commerce and riches in France, and as it is the farthest situated from
their Flanders' army, and on these accounts an attack on it would most
probably produce the wished-for alarm and diversion. He added, that he
himself knew the town to be of no strength, and that the only place
there capable of making any defence, is Chateau Trompette, which serves
it as a citadel, and was intended, as almost all citadels are, more as a
curb, than a defence, on the inhabitants. But though these circumstances
promised some success, he observed that there were many other
difficulties to struggle with, which threw a mighty damp on these
promising expectations. In the first place, he much questioned if there
was in the fleet any one person who had been ashore on the western coast
of France, except himself, who was once at Bourdeaux; and he, too, was a
stranger to all the country betwixt the town and the sea. He had no
single map of any part of France on board with him; and what
intelligence he may be able to force from the people of the country can
be but little to be depended on, as it must be their interest to mislead
him. And if money prove necessary, either for obtaining intelligence,
carrying on of works, or even subsisting the officers, he must raise it
in the country; for, except a few chests of Mexican dollars, consigned
to other uses, he carried no money with him. If he advanced any where
into the country, he must be at a very great loss for want of horses to
draw the artillery; as the inhabitants will undoubtedly carry off as
many of them as they could, and he had neither hussars nor dragoons to
force them back again. And as to the preserving any conquests he might
make, (of which the Duke had dropped some hints,) he observed that every
place which was not impregnable to him, with such small force, must be
untenable by him. On the whole, he engaged for nothing but obedience; he
promised no success; he professed absolute ignorance with regard to
every circumstance of the undertaking; he even could not fix on any
particular undertaking; and yet he lay under positive orders to sail
with the first fair wind, to approach the unknown coast, march through
the unknown country, and attack the unknown cities of the most potent
nation of the universe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Admiral Anson, who had put into Plymouth, and had been
detained there by the same contrary winds, which still prevailed, had a
conversation with the General and Admiral on the subject of their
enterprise. He told them, that he remembered to have once casually heard
from Mr. Hume, member for Southwark, <!-- Page 445 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_445" id="Page_v1_445">[445]</a></span>that he had been at L'Orient, and
that, though it be very strong by sea, it is not so by land. Though Mr.
Hume, the gentleman mentioned, be bred to a mercantile profession, not
to war, and though the intelligence received from him was only casual,
imperfect, and by second-hand, yet it gave pleasure to the Admiral and
General, as it afforded them a faint glimmering ray in their present
obscurity and ignorance; and they accordingly resolved to follow it.
They wrote to the Duke of Newcastle, September the 3d, that 'twas to
L'Orient they intended to bend their course, as soon as the wind
offered. To remedy the ignorance of the coast and want of pilots, as far
as possible, Commodore Cotes in the Ruby, together with Captain Stewart
in the Hastings, and a sloop and tender, was immediately despatched by
the Admiral to view Port L'Orient and all the places near it, so far as
might regard the safe approach and anchorage of the ships. The ignorance
of the country, and want of guides, was a desperate evil, for which the
General could provide no remedy. But as the wind still continued
contrary to the fleet and transports, though single ships of war might
work their way against it, the General had occasion to see farther
alterations made by the ministry in their project of an invasion.</p>

<p>The Duke of Newcastle, who had before informed the General that, if he
could establish himself on any part of the coast of France, two
battalions of the Guards, and General Huske's regiment, should be
despatched after him, now says, (Sept. 3,) that these three battalions
have got immediate orders to follow him. He farther adds, that if the
General finds it impracticable to make any descent on the coast of
Brittany, or higher up in the Bay of Biscay, he would probably find, on
his return, some intelligence sent him, by the reinforcement, with
regard to the coast of Normandy. Next day the Duke changes his mind, and
sends immediately this intelligence with regard to the coast of
Normandy, and a plan for annoying the French on that quarter, proposed
by Major Macdonald; and to this plan he seems entirely to give the
preference to the other, of making an attempt on the western coast of
France, to which he had before confined the Admiral and General. They
considered the plan, and conversed with Major Macdonald, who came down
to Plymouth a few days after. They found that this plan had been given
in some years before, and was not in the least calculated for the
present expedition, but required a body of cavalry as an essential point
towards its execution; an advantage of which the General was entirely
destitute. They found that Major Macdonald had had so few opportunities
of improving himself in the art of war, that it would be dangerous,
without farther information, <!-- Page 446 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_446" id="Page_v1_446">[446]</a></span>to follow his plan in any military
operations. They found that he pretended only to know the strength of
the town, and nature of the country, in that province, but had never
acquainted himself with the sea-coast, or pitched upon any proper place
for disembarkation. They considered that a very considerable step had
been already taken towards the execution of the other project on the
coast of Brittany, viz. the sending Commodore Cotes to inspect and sound
the coast; and that the same step must now be taken anew, in so late a
season, with regard to the coast of Normandy. They thought that, if
their whole operations were to begin, an attempt on the western coast
was preferable, chiefly because of its remoteness from the Flanders'
army, which must increase and spread the alarm, if the country were
really so defenceless as was believed. They represented all those
reasons to the Secretary; but at the same time expressed their
intentions of remaining at Plymouth till they should receive his
majesty's positive orders with regard to the enterprise on which they
were to engage.</p>

<p>The Duke immediately despatched a messenger, with full powers to them to
go whithersoever they pleased. During this interval, the General was
obliged, to his great regret, to remain in a manner wholly inactive.
Plymouth was so remote a place, that it was not to be expected he could
there get any proper intelligence. He was bound up by his orders to such
inviolable secrecy, that he could not make any inquiries for it, or
scarce receive it, if offered. The Secretary had sent Major Macdonald,
and one Cooke, captain of a privateer, who, 'twas found, could be of no
manner of service in this undertaking. These, he said, were the only
persons he could find in London that pretended to know any thing of the
coast of France, as if the question had been with regard to the coast of
Japan or of California. The General desired to have maps of France,
chiefly of Gascony and Brittany. He receives only a map of Gascony,
together with one of Normandy. No map of Brittany; none of France; he is
obliged to set out on so important an enterprise without intelligence,
without pilots, without guides, without any map of the country to which
he was bound, except a common map, on a small scale, of the kingdom of
France, which his Aid-de-camp had been able to pick up in a shop at
Plymouth. He represented all these difficulties to the ministry; he
begged them not to flatter themselves with any success from a General
who had such obstacles to surmount, and who must leave his conduct to
the government of chance more than prudence. He was answered, that
nothing was expected of him, but to land any where he pleased in France,
to produce an alarm, and to return safe, with the fleet <!-- Page 447 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_447" id="Page_v1_447">[447]</a></span>and transports,
to the British dominions. Though he was sensible that more would be
expected by the people, yet he cheerfully despised their rash judgments,
while he acted in obedience to orders, and in the prosecution of his
duty. The fleet sailed from Plymouth on the 15th of September, and,
after a short voyage of three days, arrived, in the evening of the 18th,
off the island of Groa, where they found Commodore Cotes and Captain
Stuart, who gave them an account of the success which they had met with
in the survey of the coast near L'Orient. The place they had pitched on
for landing, was ten miles from that town, at the mouth of the river of
Quimperlay. They represented it as a flat open shore, with deep water:
on these accounts a good landing-place for the troops, but a dangerous
place for the ships to ride in, on account of the rocks with which it
was every where surrounded, and the high swell which was thrown in, from
the Bay of Biscay, by the west and south-west winds.</p>

<p>It was then about eight in the evening, a full moon and a clear sky,
with a gentle breeze blowing in shore. The question was, whether to sail
directly to the landing-place, or hold off till morning. The two
officers who had surveyed the coast were divided in opinion: one
recommended the former measure, the other suggested some scruples, by
representing the dangerous rocks that lay on every side of them, and the
ignorance of all the pilots with regard to their number and situation.
The Admiral was determined, by these reasons, to agree to this opinion.
The question seemed little important, as it regarded only a short delay;
but really was of the utmost consequence, and was, indeed, the spring
whence all the ill success in this expedition flowed.</p>

<p>The great age of Admiral Listock, as it increased his experience, should
make us cautious of censuring his opinion in sea affairs, where he was
allowed to have such consummate knowledge. But at the same time, it may
beget a suspicion, that being now in the decline of life, he was thence
naturally inclined rather to the prudent counsels which suit a concerted
enterprise, than to the bold temerity which belongs to such hasty and
blind undertakings. The unhappy consequences of this over-cautious
measure immediately appeared. The Admiral had laid his account, that by
a delay, which procured a greater safety to the fleet and transports,
only four or five hours would be lost; but the wind changing in the
morning, and blowing fresh off shore, all next day, and part of next
night, was spent before the ships could reach the landing-place. Some of
them were not able to reach it till two days after.</p>

<p>During this time, the fleet lay full in view of the coast, and
<!-- Page 448 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_448" id="Page_v1_448">[448]</a></span>preparations were making in Port Louis, L'Orient, and over the whole
country, for the reception of an enemy, who threatened them with so
unexpected an invasion.</p>

<p>The force of France, either for offence or defence, consists chiefly in
three different bodies of men: first, in a numerous veteran army, which
was then entirely employed in Italy and on their frontiers, except some
shattered regiments, which were dispersed about the country, for the
advantage of recruiting, and of which there were two regiments of
dragoons at that time in Brittany; secondly, in a regular and
disciplined militia, with which all the fortified cities along the
sea-coast were garrisoned, and many of the frontier towns, that seemed
not to be threatened with any immediate attack. Some bodies of this
militia had also been employed in the field with the regular troops, and
had acquired honour, which gave spirits and courage to the rest:
thirdly, in a numerous body of coast militia, or gardes-du-cote,
amounting to near 200,000, ill armed and ill disciplined, formidable
alone by their numbers; and in Brittany, by the ferocity of the
inhabitants, esteemed of old and at present, the most warlike and least
civilized of all the French peasants. Regular signals were concerted for
the assembling of these forces, by alarm guns, flags, and fires; and in
the morning of the 20th of September, by break of day, a considerable
body of all these different kinds of troops, but chiefly of the last,
amounting to above 3000 men, were seen upon the sea-shore to oppose the
disembarkation of the British forces. A disposition, therefore, of ships
and boats must be made for the regular landing of the army; and as the
weather was then very blustering, and the wind blew almost off shore,
this could not be effected till afternoon.</p>

<p>There appeared, in view of the fleet, three places which seemed proper
for a disembarkation, and which were separated from each other either by
a rising ground, or by a small arm of the sea. The French militia had
posted themselves in the two places which lay nearest to L'Orient; and
finding that they were not numerous enough to cover the whole, they left
the third, which lay to the windward, almost wholly defenceless. The
General ordered the boats to rendezvous opposite to this beach; and he
saw the French troops march off from the next contiguous landing-place,
and take post opposite to him. They placed themselves behind some
sandbanks, in such a manner as to be entirely sheltered from the cannon
of those English ships which covered the landing, while at the same time
they could rush in upon the troops, as soon as their approach to the
shore had obliged the ships to leave off firing.</p>

<p>The General remarked their plan of defence, and was determined <!-- Page 449 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_449" id="Page_v1_449">[449]</a></span>to
disappoint them. He observed, that the next landing-place to the leeward
was now empty; and that, though the troops which had been posted on the
more distant beach had quitted their station, and were making a circuit
round an arm of the sea, in order to occupy the place deserted by the
others, they had not as yet reached it. He immediately seized the
opportunity. He ordered his boats to row directly forward, as if he
intended to land on the beach opposite to him; but while the enemy were
expecting him to advance, he ordered the boats to turn, at a signal;
and, making all the speed that both oars and sails could give them, to
steer directly to the place deserted by the enemy. In order to render
the disembarkation more safe, he had previously ordered two tenders to
attack a battery, which had been placed on a mount towards the right,
and which was well situated for annoying the boats on their approach.
The tenders succeeded in chasing the French from their guns; the boats
reached the shore before any of the French could be opposite to them.
The soldiers landed, to the number of about six hundred men, and formed
in an instant; immediately upon which the whole militia dispersed and
fled up into the country. The English followed them regularly and in
good order; prognosticating success to the enterprise from such a
fortunate beginning.</p>

<p>There was a creek, or arm of the sea, dry at low water, which lay on the
right hand of the landing-place, and through which ran the nearest road
to L'Orient, and the only one fit for the march of troops, or the
draught of cannon and heavy carriages. As it was then high water, the
French runaways were obliged, by this creek, to make a circuit of some
miles; and they thereby misled the general, who, justly concluding they
would take shelter in that town, and having no other guides to conduct
him, thought that, by following their footsteps, he would be led the
readiest and shortest way to L'Orient. He detached, therefore, in
pursuit of the flying militia, about a thousand men, under the command
of Brigadier O'Farrel; who, after being harassed by some firing from the
hedges, (by which Lieut.-Col. Erskine, Quarter-Master General, was
dangerously wounded,) arrived that evening at Guidel, a village about a
league distant from the landing-place. The general himself lay near the
sea-shore, to wait for the landing of the rest of the forces. By break
of day he led them up to join the brigadier at Guidel. He there learned
from some peasants, taken prisoners, and who spoke the French language,
(which few of the common people in Brittany are able to do,) that the
road into which he had been led, by the reasons above specified, was the
longest by four or five miles. He was also informed, what he had partly
seen, that the road was very <!-- Page 450 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_450" id="Page_v1_450">[450]</a></span>dangerous and difficult, running through
narrow lanes and defiles, betwixt high hedges, faced with stone walls,
and bordered in many places with thick woods and brushes, where a very
few disciplined and brave troops might stop a whole army; and where even
a few, without discipline or bravery, might, by firing suddenly upon the
forces, throw them into confusion.</p>

<p>In order to acquire a more thorough knowledge of the country, of which
he and the whole army were utterly ignorant, he here divided the troops
into two equal bodies, and marched them up to L'Orient, by two different
roads, which were pointed out to him. The one part, which he himself
conducted, passed without much molestation. The other, under Brigadier
O'Farrel, was not so fortunate. Two battalions of that detachment,
Richbell's and Frampton's, partly from their want of experience, and
partly from the terror naturally inspired into soldiers by finding
themselves in a difficult country unknown both to themselves and
leaders, and partly, perhaps, from accident, to which the courage of men
is extremely liable, fell into confusion, before a handful of French
peasants who fired at them from behind the hedges. Notwithstanding all
the endeavours of the Brigadier, many of them threw down their arms, and
ran away; others fired in confusion, and wounded each other; and if any
regular forces had been present to take advantage of this disorder, the
most fatal consequences might have ensued. And though they were at last
led on, and joined the general that evening before L'Orient, the panic
still remained in these two battalions afterwards, and communicated
itself to others; kept the whole army in anxiety, even when they were
not in danger, and threw a mighty damp on the expectations of success,
conceived from this undertaking. L'Orient, lately a small village, now a
considerable town, on the coast of Brittany, lies in the extremity of a
fine bay, the mouth of which is very narrow, and guarded by the strong
citadel of Port Louis. This town has become the centre of the French
East India trade, the seat of the company established for that commerce,
and the magazine whence they distribute the East India commodities. The
great prizes made upon them by the English, during the course of the
war, had given a check to this growing commerce; yet still the town was
esteemed a valuable acquisition, were it only on account of the wealth
it contained, and the store-houses of the company, a range of stately
buildings, erected at public charge, both for use and ornament. The town
itself is far from being strong. Two sides of it, which are not
protected with water, are defended only with a plain wall, near thirty
feet high, of no great thickness, and without any fosse or parapet. But
the water which covers the <!-- Page 451 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_451" id="Page_v1_451">[451]</a></span>other two sides, rendered it impossible to
be invested, and gave an opportunity for multitudes of people to throw
themselves into it from every corner of that populous country. And
though these, for want of discipline, could not be trusted in the field
against regular forces, yet became they of great use in a defence behind
walls, by throwing up works, erecting batteries, and digging trenches,
to secure (what was sufficient) for a few days, a weak town against a
small and ill-provided army. The East India Company had numbers of
cannon in their magazines, and had there erected a school of engineers,
for the service of their ships and settlements; the vessels in the
harbour supplied them with more cannon, and with seamen accustomed to
their management and use; and whatever was wanting, either in artillery
or warlike stores, could easily be brought by water from Port Louis,
with which the town of L'Orient kept always an open communication.</p>

<p>But as these advantages, though great, require both a sufficient
presence of mind, and some time, to be employed against an enemy, 'tis
not improbable, that if the admiral had been supplied with proper
pilots, and the general with proper guides, which could have led the
English immediately upon the coast, and to the town, the very terror of
so unexpected an invasion would have rendered the inhabitants incapable
of resistance, and made them surrender at discretion. The want of these
advantages had already lost two days; and more time must yet be
consumed, before they could so much as make the appearance of an attack.
Cannon was wanting, and the road by which the army had marched, was
absolutely unfit for the conveyance of them. The general, therefore,
having first despatched an officer and a party to reconnoitre the
country, and find a nearer and better road, September 22d, went himself
next day to the sea-shore, for the same purpose, and also in order to
concert with the admiral the proper method of bringing up cannon; as
almost all the horses in the country, which are extremely weak and of a
diminutive size, had been driven away by the peasants. Accordingly, a
road was found, much nearer, though still ten miles of length; and much
better, though easily rendered impassable by rainy weather, as was
afterwards experienced.</p>

<p>A council of war was held on board the Princessa, consisting of the
admiral and general, Brigadier O'Farrel and Commodore Cotes. The
engineers, Director-General Armstrong, and Captain Watson, who had
surveyed the town of L'Orient, being called in, were asked their opinion
with regard to the practicability of an attempt on it, together with the
time, and artillery, and ammunition, requisite for that purpose. Their
answer was, that with two twelve <!-- Page 452 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_452" id="Page_v1_452">[452]</a></span>pounders, and a ten inch mortar,
planted on the spot which they had pitched on for erecting a battery,
they engaged either to make a practicable breach in the walls, or with
cartridges, bombs, and red-hot balls, destroy the town, by laying it in
ashes in twenty-four hours. Captain Chalmers, the captain of the
artillery, who had not then seen the town, was of the same opinion, from
their description of it, provided the battery was within the proper
distance. Had the king's orders been less positive for making an attempt
on some part of the coast of France, yet such flattering views offered
by men who promised what lay within the sphere of their own profession,
must have engaged the attention of the admiral and general, and induced
them to venture on a much more hazardous and difficult undertaking.
'Twas accordingly agreed that four twelve pounders, and a ten inch
mortar, together with three field-pieces, should be drawn up to the camp
by sailors, in order to make, with still greater assurance, the attempt,
whose success seemed so certain to the engineers. These pieces of
artillery, with the stores demanded, notwithstanding all difficulties,
were drawn to the camp in two days, except two twelve pounders, which
arrived not till the day afterwards. A third part of the sailors of the
whole fleet, together with all the marines, were employed in this
drudgery; the admiral gave all assistance in his power to the general;
and the public, in one instance, saw that it was not impossible for land
and sea officers to live in harmony together, and concur in promoting
the success of an enterprise.</p>

<p>The general, on his arrival in the camp, found the officer returned whom
he had sent to summon the town of L'Orient. By his information, it
appeared that the inhabitants were so much alarmed by the suddenness of
this incursion, and the terror of a force, which their fears magnified,
as to think of surrendering, though upon conditions, which would have
rendered the conquest of no avail to their enemies. The inhabitants
insisted upon an absolute security to their houses and goods; the East
India Company to their magazines and store-houses; and the garrison,
consisting of about seven hundred regular militia and troops, besides a
great number of irregulars, demanded a liberty of marching out with all
the honours of war. A weak town that opened its gates on such conditions
was not worth the entering; since it must immediately be abandoned,
leaving only to its conquerors the shame of their own folly, and perhaps
the reproach of treachery. The general, therefore, partly trusting to
the promise of the engineers, and partly desirous of improving the
advantages gained by the present danger, when the deputies arrived next
day, September 23d, from the governor, from the <!-- Page 453 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_453" id="Page_v1_453">[453]</a></span>town, and from the East
India Company, refused to receive any articles but those from the
governor, who commanded in the name of his most Christian majesty. He
even refused liberty to the garrison to march out; well knowing that, as
the town was not invested, they could take that liberty whenever they
pleased.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, every accident concurred to render the enterprise of the
English abortive. Some deserters got into the town, who informed the
garrison of the true force of the English, which, conjecturing from the
greatness and number of the ships, they had much magnified. Even this
small body diminished daily, from the fatigue of excessive duty, and
from the great rains that began to fall. Scarce three thousand were left
to do duty, which still augmented the fatigue to the few that remained;
especially when joined to the frequent alarms, that the unaccountable
panic they were struck with made but too frequent. Rains had so spoilt
the roads as to render it impracticable to bring up any heavier cannon,
or more of the same calibre, so long a way, by the mere force of seamen.
But what, above all things, made the enterprise appear desperate, was
the discovery of the ignorance of the engineers, chiefly of the
director-general, who in the whole course of his proceedings appeared
neither to have skill in contrivance, nor order and diligence in
execution. His own want of capacity and experience, made his projects of
no use; his blind obstinacy rendered him incapable of making use of the
capacity of others. Though the general offered to place and support the
battery wherever the engineer thought proper, he chose to set it above
six hundred yards from the wall, where such small cannon could do no
manner of execution. He planted it at so oblique an angle to the wall
that the ball thrown from the largest cannon must have recoiled, without
making any impression. He trusted much to the red-hot balls, with which
he promised to lay the town in ashes in twenty-four hours; yet, by his
negligence, or that of others, the furnace with which these balls were
to be heated, was forgot. After the furnace was brought, he found that
the bellows, and other implements necessary for the execution of that
work, were also left on board the store-ships. With great difficulty,
and infinite pains, ammunition and artillery stores were drawn up from
the sea-shore in tumbrels. He was totally ignorant, till some days
after, that he had along with him ammunition wagons, which would have
much facilitated this labour. His orders to the officers of the train
were so confused, or so ill obeyed, that no ammunition came regularly up
to the camp, to serve the few cannon and the mortars that played upon
the town. Not only fascines, piquets, and every thing necessary for the
battery, were supplied <!-- Page 454 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_454" id="Page_v1_454">[454]</a></span>him beyond his demand; but even workmen,
notwithstanding the great fatigue and small numbers of the army. These
workmen found no addition to their fatigue in obeying his orders. He
left them often unemployed, for want of knowing in what business he
should occupy them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French garrison, being so weakly attacked, had leisure to
prepare for a defence, and make proper use of their great number of
workmen, if not of soldiers, and the nearness and plenty of their
military stores. By throwing up earth in the inside of the wall, they
had planted a great many cannon, some of a large calibre, and opened six
batteries against one that played upon them from the English. The
distance alone of the besiegers' battery, made these cannon of the enemy
do less execution; but that same distance rendered the attack absolutely
ineffectual. Were the battery brought nearer, to a hundred paces for
instance, 'twould be requisite to make it communicate with the camp by
trenches and a covered way, to dig which was the work of some days for
so small an army. During this time, the besieged, foreseeing the place
to which the attack must be directed, could easily fortify it by
retrenchments in the inside of the wall; and planting ten cannon to one,
could silence the besiegers' feeble battery in a few hours. They would
not even have had leisure to make a breach in the thin wall, which first
discovered itself; and that breach, if made, could not possibly serve to
any purpose. Above fifteen thousand men, completely armed by the East
India Company, and brave while protected by cannon and ramparts, still
stood in opposition to three thousand, discouraged with fatigue, with
sickness, and with despair of ever succeeding in so unequal a contest.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p>A certain foreign writer, more anxious to tell his stories in an
entertaining manner than to assure himself of their reality, has
endeavoured to put this expedition in a ridiculous light; but as there
is not one circumstance of his narration, which has truth in it, or even
the least appearance of truth, it would be needless to lose time in
refuting it. With regard to the prejudices of the public, a few
questions may suffice.</p>

<p>Was the attempt altogether impracticable from the beginning? The general
neither proposed it, nor planned it, nor approved it, nor answered for
its success. Did the disappointment proceed from want of expedition? He
had no pilots, guides, nor intelligence, afforded him; and could not
possibly provide himself in any of these advantages, so necessary to all
military operations. Were the engineers blamable? This has always been
considered <!-- Page 455 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_455" id="Page_v1_455">[455]</a></span>as a branch of military knowledge, distinct from that of a
commander, and which is altogether intrusted to those to whose
profession it peculiarly belongs. By his vigour in combating the vain
terrors spread amongst the troops, and by his prudence in timely
desisting from a fruitless enterprise, the misfortune was confined
merely to a disappointment, without any loss or any dishonour to the
British arms. Commanders, from the situation of affairs, have had
opportunities of acquiring more honour; yet there is no one whose
conduct, in every circumstance, could be more free from reproach. On the
first of October, the fleet sailed out of Quimperlay Road, from one of
the most dangerous situations that so large a fleet had ever lain in, at
so late a season, and in so stormy a sea as the Bay of Biscay. The
reflection on this danger had been no inconsiderable cause of hastening
the re-embarkation of the troops. And the more so, that the secretary
had given express orders to the admiral not to bring the fleet into any
hazard. The prudence of the hasty departure appeared the more visibly
the very day the fleet sailed, when a violent storm arising from the
south west, it was concluded, that if the ships had been lying at anchor
on the coast, many of them must have necessarily been driven ashore, and
wrecked on the rocks that surrounded them. The fleet was dispersed, and
six transports being separated from the rest, went immediately for
England, carrying with them about eight hundred of the forces. The rest
put into Quiberon Bay, and the general landed his small body on the
peninsula of that name. By erecting a battery of some guns on the narrow
neck of land, which joins the peninsula to the continent, he rendered
his situation almost impregnable, while he saw the fleet riding secure
in his neighbourhood, in one of the finest bays in the world.</p>

<p>The industry and spirit of the general supported both himself and the
army against all these disadvantages, while there was the smallest
prospect of success. But his prudence determined him to abandon it, when
it appeared altogether desperate.</p>

<p>The engineers, seeing no manner of effect from their shells and red-hot
balls, and sensible that 'twas impossible either to make a breach from a
battery, erected at so great a distance, or to place the battery nearer,
under such a superiority of French cannon, at last unanimously brought a
report to the general, that they had no longer any hope of success; and
that even all the ammunition, which, with infinite labour, had been
brought, was expended: no prospect remained of being farther supplied,
on account of the broken roads, which lay between them and the fleet.
The council of war held in consequence of this report, balanced the
reasons for continuing <!-- Page 456 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v1_456" id="Page_v1_456">[456]</a></span>or abandoning the enterprise, if men can be said
to balance where they find nothing on the one side but an extreme desire
to serve their king and country, and on the other every maxim of war and
prudence. They unanimously agreed to abandon the attempt, and return on
board the transports. The whole troops were accordingly re-embarked by
the 28th of September, with the loss of near twenty men killed and
wounded, on the whole enterprise.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;La traduction de vos discours politiques, que j'ai l'honneur
de vous envoyer, est la preuve la plus éclatante que je pouvois vous
donner de l'estime que j'en fais; vous en serez peut-être plus content
si j'avois été à portée de profiter de vos lumières. Je vous prie, et
votre intérêt s'y trouve comme le mien, de me faire la grâce de la lire
avec attention, et de m'avertir des endroits, ou malgré toute
l'attention que j'y ai apportée, j'aurois pu m'écarter de votre sens.
J'en profiterai à la première édition, ainsi que des remarques,
changements, ou additions, qu'il vous plaira me communiquer, soit à
l'occasion de vos discours, soit sur les autres ouvrages Anglois dont je
parle dans mes notes.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je vous prie encore Monsieur que ce soit le plus tôt qu'il vous sera
possible, car il est bon de vous dire que cette traduction, grâce à
l'excellence de l'original, se débite ici comme un Roman; c'est tout
dire, notre goût pour les futilités vous est connu; il vous étoit
réservé de nous y faire renoncer, pour nous occuper des matières les
plus dignes d'exercer les esprits raisonnables. Le Libraire m'avertit
qu'il sera bientôt tems de penser à la seconde édition. J'attendrai
votre réponse pour l'enrichir de vos remarques qui feront que celle-ci
sera reçue du public avec encore plus d'applaudissements.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je profite de cette occasion pour vous offrir une amitié qui vous sera,
peut-être, inutile, et vous demander la vôtre que je serois très flatté
d'obtenir. Il semble que l'auteur et le traducteur sont faits pour être
liés ensemble: il est à présumer qui celui que traduit un ouvrage a
d'avance ou du moins épousé la façon de parler de celui qui l'a fait.
J'ai trouvé dans vos discours un politique Philosophe, et un Philosophe
citoyen. Je n'ai moi-même donné aucun ouvrage qui ne porte ce double
caractère, et je me flatte que vous le trouverez <!-- Page 459 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_459" id="Page_v1_459">[459]</a></span>dans les Lettres d'un
François, si par hazard elles vous sont connues.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'ai l'honneur d'être, avec les sentiments d'estime dont je viens de
vous donner des témoignages publics, et cette sorte de respect que je
n'ai que pour quelques Philosophes tels que vous. Monsieur, votre très
humble et très obéissant serviteur,</p>

<h4>(2.)</h4>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;La traduction de vos discours politiques est la première que
j'ai donnée au public; et l'utilité que j'ai cru que ma patrie en
pouvoit retirer, est l'unique motif que m'ait déterminé à
l'entreprendre. Je n'ose me répondre que vous la trouverez telle que
vous l'espérez. C'est à moi à vous demander votre indulgence pour les
fautes que vous y trouverez, et à vous prier de me communiquer vos
remarques sur des notes que j'ai cru y devoir adjouter. Je vous promets
de corriger avec soumission les erreurs que vos m'y ferez apercevoir. A
la fin du 2d vol. j'ai donné une notice des meilleurs ouvrages Anglois
que j'ai consultés, sur les matières du commerce; j'ai hazardé de porter
mon jugement sur chacun de ceux dont j'ai parlé. Je le rectifierai sur
vos lumières, si vous voulez bien me les communiquer. Si j'en ai omis
quelqu'un d'important, je vous prie de me le faire connoître, et de me
dire vous-même, qui êtes un si excellent juge, ce que l'on en doit
penser. J'enricherai la 2 Edition de tout ce dont vous voudrez bien me
faire part.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l'égard de votre histoire de la Grande Bretagne que vous m'annoncez,
ce ne sera plus simplement comme votre admirateur mais comme votre ami
Monsieur, que j'en entreprendrai la traduction, et je ferai de mon mieux
pour qu'elle perde le moins qu'il est possible. J'aime votre façon de
penser, et je suis familiarisé avec votre stile; si la matière exige
qu'il soit plus élevé je tacherai d'y atteindre. Mais pour que je puisse
entreprendre cette traduction avec succès, il faut s'il est possible,
que vous retardiez à Londres au moins d'un mois la publication de votre
ouvrage, et que vous me l'envoyez tout de suite par la poste, addressé
sans autre enveloppe à Mr. Jannes, Chevalier de l'ordre du Roi,
Controlleur Général des Postes à Paris. Nous avons ici une foule
d'écrivains médiocres, qui sans savoir ni l'Anglois ni le François même,
sont a l'affût de tout ce qui s'imprime chez vous, et qui à l'aide d'un
dictionnaire vous massacreront impitoyablement. On nous a donné ainsi
plusieurs bons ouvrages, et entre autres la dissertation de M. Wallace
dont <!-- Page 460 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_460" id="Page_v1_460">[460]</a></span>il n'est pas possible de supporter la lecture en François. Pour
faire de pareille besogne, il ne faut pas beaucoup de tems à ces
Messieurs là. Ils travaillent vîte, parce qu'ils travaillent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fami
potius quam famæ</i>. Si je n'ai pas du tems devant eux, je serai prévenu,
et si je le suis, je serai obligé d'abandonner l'ouvrage. Je ne vous
parle pas des traducteurs de Hollande qui sont encore plus mauvais s'il
est possible. Cette fois-ci je veux faire un office d'amitié, je vous
prie de me mettre à portée de le bien faire. Vos discours Politiques
vous ont, comme je m'y attendois, donné ici la plus haute réputation,
dès que votre histoire paroîtra, un libraire la fera venir par la poste,
et mettra ses ouvriers après, à moins que vous ne m'accordiez la grâce
que je vous demande. Alors on saura que je la traduis, et je suis sûr
que ces messieurs me laisseront faire.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'ai encore à vous apprendre, monsieur, que le succès de vos Discours
Politiques ne fait qu'augmenter tous les jours, et que tout retentit de
vos Éloges. Nos ministres même n'en sont pas moins satisfaits que le
public. Mr. le Comte d'Argenson, Mr. Le Maréchal de Noailles, en un mot
tous ceux qui ont ici part au gouvernement ont parlé de votre ouvrage,
comme d'un des meilleurs qui ayent jamais été faits sur ces matières.
J'ai été obligé de céder mon exemplaire à un d'entre eux; ainsi je vous
prie de m'en adresser un par la même voie que je vous ai indiquée, la
poste après que vous m'aurez envoyé le I. vol. de votre histoire,
d'autant plus que les additions et corrections dont vous m'avez fait
part se rapportent à la 3^e edition qui je crois se trouveroit
difficilement a Paris.</p>


<h4>(3.)</h4>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;Je vous avois promis, et je m'étois flatté de pouvoir
consacrer mes veilles à traduire aussi votre admirable Histoire de
l'infortunée Maison de Stewart. Les obstacles les plus puissants,
ceux-mêmes qui ôtent à l'esprit cette liberté sans laquelle on ne fait
rien de bien, voyages, affaires, disgrâces, maladies&mdash;tout s'est opposé
à l'exécution d'un projet qui rioit si fort à mon imagination et dont
l'exécution ne pouroit que me faire honneur.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A ce défaut j'ai prêté à un de mes amis, homme d'esprit et laborieux, le
premier volume que vous avez eu la bonté de m'envoyer. Il l'a traduit et
le rendra public au commencement de l'hiver prochain.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'ai de même que tous ceux qui savent ici l'Anglois, le plus grand
empressement de lire votre second volume. J'en ferai le même usage que
du premier.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je vous avois annoncé que vos discours Politiques feroient parmi nous le
même effet que <cite>L'Esprit des Loix</cite>. L'évènement m'a justifié, non
seulement ils jouissent parmi nous de cette haute <!-- Page 461 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_461" id="Page_v1_461">[461]</a></span>réputation qu'ils
méritent, mais ils ont donné lieu à un grand nombre d'autres ouvrages
plus ou moins estimables et qui la plus part n'ont d'original que la
forme. Vous en trouverez le catalogue à la suite d'une troisième édition
de ma traduction que je vais donner incessamment.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il vient d'en paroître un qui fait ici un grand bruit, et que je n'ai
garde de confondre avec tous ceux dont je viens de parler. Il est
intitulé, <cite class="sc">L'Ami des Hommes ou Traité de La Population</cite>. L'Auteur est un
génie hardi, original, qui comme Montaigne se laisse aller à ses idées,
les expose sans orgueil, sans modestie; il ne suit ni ordre ni méthode;
mais son ouvrage, plein d'excellentes choses, respire le bien de
l'humanité et de la patrie. Il prêche l'agriculture, et foudroye la
finance. Il combat votre système sur le luxe, mais avec les égards
élevés à la superiorité de vos lumières. Il m'a remis un exemplaire de
son ouvrage, qu'il me prie de vous présenter comme un tribut de son
estime et de la reconnoissance qu'il vous doit, pour l'utilité qu'il a
tirée de vos Discours Politiques. Il ne demande pas mieux que d' être
éclairé et par la noblesse des sentiments et la politesse de la
conduite. Je ne crains pas de le dire. L'adversaire est digne de vous.
C'est <em>Monsieur le Marquis de Mirabeau</em>, qui est tel qu'il paroît dans
son livre&mdash;c'est à dire un des plus extraordinaires des hommes qu'il y
ait en quelque pays que ce soit. Je vous prie Monsieur de m'indiquer une
voie sûre pour vous faire parvenir son ouvrage.</p>

<p class="letterdateit" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dresde, le 25 Dec. 1754.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'ai vu ici la traduction de vos Discours Politiques imprimée en
Hollande; elle ne se peut pas lire; vous souffririez vous, Monsieur, de
vous voir ainsi défiguré. Le Traducteur quel qu'il soit ne sait
constamment ni l'Anglois ni le François. C'est probablement un de ces
auteurs qui travaillent à la foire pour les libraires de Hollande, et
dont les ouvrages bons ou mauvais se débitent aux foires de Leipsig et
de Francfort. Les bibliothèques de ce pays ci sont remplies de livres
François qui n'ont jamais été et ne seront jamais connus en France.
Cette traduction passe ici pour être d'un Mr. Mauvillon de Leipsic dont
le métier est de faire des livres François pour L'Allemagne, et
d'enseigner ce qu'il ne sait&mdash;c'est à dire, votre langue et la nôtre. Ce
qu'il y a de Saxons lettrés qui les possèdent l'une ou l'autre, et qui
s'intéressent au bien de leur pays, connoissent l'excellence de votre
ouvrage, me pressent de faire imprimer à Dresde même la seconde édition
de ma traduction, et je pourrois bien me rendre à leur avis. Je
n'attends plus que <!-- Page 462 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_462" id="Page_v1_462">[462]</a></span>votre réponse pour me décider. Quelque part qu'elle
se fasse, je tâcherai de faire en sorte qu'elle soit belle et correcte.</p>


<h4>(5.)</h4>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,&mdash;Il y a à peu près un an que notre commerce épistolaire a
commencé, et j'ai grand regret que par des contretems de tout espèce il
ait été sitôt interrompu. Vous m'avez donné trop de preuves de votre
politesse pour que je ne sois pas à présent convaincu que vous n'avez
reçu aucune des lettres que je vous ai écrites de Dresde, et que j'avois
essayé de vous faire passer par la voie de votre ambassadeur à cette
cour. Prêt a quitter la Saxe, je vous écrivis encor de Leïpzic, pour
vous rendre compte de mon séjour en ce pays, et vous dire que la
dissipation où j'y avois vécu forcément, ne m'avoit pas permis d'avancer
beaucoup dans la traduction de votre histoire de la malheureuse famille
des Stuarts. J'ai depuis été en Hollande, et, comme je l'avois prévu
j'ai appris qu'un de ces auteurs, qui travaillent à la fois aux gages
des libraires qui les employent, en avoit fait une de son coté, qui
étoit toute prête à paroître. Vous pouvez aisément juger du
découragement où une pareille nouvelle m'a jetté. La manufacture des
livres de Hollande fait réellement grand tort à notre littérature
Françoise. On y employe à traduire un excellent ouvrage des gens qui ne
seroient bons qu'à travailler à la fabrique du papier.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX C.<br />

<small>DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE POEMS OF OSSIAN.</small></h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>


<h4>(1.)</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">Edinburgh, August 16, 1760.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am not surprised to find by your letter, that Mr. Gray should
have entertained suspicions with regard to the authenticity of these
fragments of our Highland poetry. The first time I was shown the copies
of some of them in manuscript, by our friend John Home, I was inclined
to be a little incredulous on that head; but Mr. Home removed my
scruples, by informing me of the manner in which he procured them from
Mr. Macpherson, the translator.</p>

<p><!-- Page 463 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_463" id="Page_v1_463">[463]</a></span>These two gentlemen were drinking the waters together at Moffat last
autumn, when their conversation fell upon Highland poetry, which Mr.
Macpherson extolled very highly. Our friend, who knew him to be a good
scholar, and a man of taste, found his curiosity excited, and asked
whether he had ever translated any of them. Mr. Macpherson replied, that
he never had attempted any such thing; and doubted whether it was
possible to transfuse such beauties into our language; but, for Mr.
Home's satisfaction, and in order to give him a general notion of the
strain of that wild poetry, he would endeavour to turn one of them into
English. He accordingly brought him one next day, which our friend was
so much pleased with, that he never ceased soliciting Mr. Macpherson,
till he insensibly produced that small volume which has been published.</p>

<p>After this volume was in every body's hands, and universally admired, we
heard every day new reasons, which put the authenticity, not the great
antiquity which the translator ascribes to them, beyond all question;
for their antiquity is a point, which must be ascertained by reasoning;
though the arguments he employs seem very probable and convincing. But
certain it is, that these poems are in every body's mouth in the
Highlands, have been handed down from father to son, and are of an age
beyond all memory and tradition.</p>

<p>In the family of every Highland chieftain, there was anciently retained
a bard, whose office was the same with that of the Greek rhapsodists;
and the general subject of the poems which they recited was the wars of
Fingal; an epoch no less remarkable among them, than the wars of Troy
among the Greek poets. This custom is not even yet altogether abolished:
the bard and piper are esteemed the most honourable offices in a
chieftain's family, and these two characters are frequently united in
the same person. Adam Smith, the celebrated Professor in Glasgow, told
me that the piper of the Argyleshire militia repeated to him all those
poems which Mr. Macpherson has translated, and many more of equal
beauty. Major Mackay, Lord Reay's brother, also told me that he
remembers them perfectly; as likewise did the Laird of Macfarlane, the
greatest antiquarian whom we have in this country, and who insists so
strongly on the historical truth, as well as on the poetical beauty of
these productions. I could add the Laird and Lady Macleod to these
authorities, with many more, if these were not sufficient, as they live
in different parts of the Highlands, very remote from each other, and
they could only be acquainted with poems that had become in a manner
national works, and had gradually spread themselves into every mouth,
and imprinted themselves on every memory.</p>

<p><!-- Page 464 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_464" id="Page_v1_464">[464]</a></span>Every body in Edinburgh is so convinced of this truth, that we have
endeavoured to put Mr. Macpherson on a way of procuring us more of these
wild flowers. He is a modest, sensible, young man, not settled in any
living, but employed as a private tutor in Mr. Grahame of Balgowan's
family, a way of life which he is not fond of. We have, therefore, set
about a subscription of a guinea or two guineas a-piece, in order to
enable him to quit that family, and undertake a mission into the
Highlands, where he hopes to recover more of these fragments. There is,
in particular, a country surgeon somewhere in Lochaber, who, he says,
can recite a great number of them, but never committed them to writing;
as indeed the orthography of the Highland language is not fixed, and the
natives have always employed more the sword than the pen. This surgeon
has by heart the Epic poem mentioned by Mr. Macpherson in his Preface;
and as he is somewhat old, and is the only person living that has it
entire, we are in the more haste to recover a monument, which will
certainly be regarded as a curiosity in the republic of letters.</p>

<p>I own that my first and chief objection to the authenticity of these
fragments, was not on account of the noble and even tender strokes which
they contain; for these are the offspring of genius and passion in all
countries; I was only surprised at the regular plan which appears in
some of these pieces, and which seems to be the work of a more
cultivated age. None of the specimens of barbarous poetry known to us,
the Hebrew, Arabian, or any other, contain this species of beauty; and
if a regular epic poem, or even any thing of that kind, nearly regular,
should also come from that rough climate or uncivilized people, it would
appear to me a phenomenon altogether unaccountable.</p>

<p>I remember Mr. Macpherson told me, that the heroes of this Highland epic
were not only, like Homer's heroes, their own butchers, bakers, and
cooks, but also their own shoemakers, carpenters, and smiths. He
mentioned an incident which put this matter in a remarkable light. A
warrior had the head of his spear struck off in battle; upon which he
immediately retires behind the army, where a large forge was erected,
makes a new one, hurries back to the action, pierces his enemy, while
the iron, which was yet red-hot, hisses in the wound. This imagery you
will allow to be singular, and so well imagined, that it would have been
adopted by Homer, had the manners of the Greeks allowed him to have
employed it.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention, as another proof of the authenticity of these
poems, and even of the reality of the adventures contained in them, that
the names of the heroes, Fingal, Oscar, Osur, Oscan, Dermid, <!-- Page 465 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_465" id="Page_v1_465">[465]</a></span>are still
given in the Highlands to large mastiffs, in the same manner as we affix
to them the names of Cæsar, Pompey, Hector, or the French that of
Marlborough.</p>

<p>It gives me pleasure to find, that a person of so fine a taste as Mr.
Gray approves of these fragments; as it may convince us, that our
fondness of them is not altogether founded on national prepossessions,
which, however, you know to be a little strong. The translation is
elegant; but I made an objection to the author, which I wish you would
communicate to Mr. Gray, that we may judge of the justness of it. There
appeared to me many verses in his prose, and all of them in the same
measure with Mr. Shenstone's famous ballad:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">"Ye shepherds so cheerful and gay,</div>
    <div class="line">Whose flocks never carelessly roam, &amp;c."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Pray, ask Mr. Gray, whether he made the same remark, &amp;c. and whether he
thinks it a blemish. Yours most sincerely, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_465:1_298" id="FNanchor_465:1_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_465:1_298" class="fnanchor">[465:1]</a></p>


<h4>(2.)</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">Lisle St. Leicester Fields, 19th Sept. 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I live in a place where I have the pleasure of frequently
hearing justice done to your Dissertation; but never heard it mentioned
in a company where some one person or other did not express his doubts
with regard to the authenticity of the poems which are its subject; and
I often hear them totally rejected with disdain and indignation, as a
palpable and most impudent forgery. This opinion has, indeed, become
very prevalent among the men of letters in London; and I can foresee,
that in a few years the poems, if they continue to stand on their
present footing, will be thrown aside, and will fall into final
oblivion. It is in vain to say that their beauty will support them,
independent of their authenticity. No; that beauty is not so much to the
general taste as to ensure you of this event; and if people be once
disgusted with the idea of a forgery, they are thence apt to entertain a
more disadvantageous notion of the excellency of the production itself.
The absurd pride and caprice of Macpherson himself, who scorns, as he
pretends, to satisfy any body that doubts his veracity, has tended much
to confirm this general scepticism; and I must own, for my own part,
that, though I have had many particular reasons to believe these poems
genuine, more than it is possible for any Englishman of <!-- Page 466 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_466" id="Page_v1_466">[466]</a></span>letters to
have, yet I am not entirely without my scruples on that head. You think
that the internal proofs in favour of the poems are very convincing; so
they are: but there are also internal reasons against them, particularly
from the manners, notwithstanding all the art with which you have
endeavoured to throw a varnish on that circumstance; and the
preservation of such long and such connected poems by oral tradition
alone, during a course of fourteen centuries, is so much out of the
ordinary course of human affairs, that it requires the strongest reasons
to make us believe it.</p>

<p>My present purpose, therefore, is to apply to you, in the name of all
the men of letters of this, and I may say of all other countries, to
establish this capital point, and to give us proof that these poems are,
I do not say so ancient as the age of Severus, but that they were not
forged within these five years by James Macpherson. These proofs must
not be arguments, but testimonies. People's ears are fortified against
the former: the latter may yet find their way before the poems are
consigned to total oblivion. Now the testimonies may, in my opinion, be
of two kinds. Macpherson pretends that there is an ancient manuscript of
part of Fingal, in the family, I think, of Clanronald. Get that fact
ascertained by more than one person of credit; let these persons be
acquainted with the Gaelic; let them compare the original and the
translation; and let them testify the fidelity of the latter. But the
chief point in which it will be necessary for you to exert yourself,
will be to get positive testimony from many different hands, that such
poems are vulgarly recited in the Highlands, and have there long been
the entertainment of the people. This testimony must be as particular as
it is positive. It will not be sufficient that a Highland gentleman or
clergyman say or write to you, that he has heard such poems; nobody
questions that there are traditional poems in that part of the country,
where the names of Ossian and Fingal, and Oscar, and Gaul, are mentioned
in every stanza. The only doubt is, whether these poems have any farther
resemblance to the poems published by Macpherson. I was told by Bourke,
a very ingenious Irish gentleman, the author of a tract on the Sublime
and Beautiful, that on the first publication of Macpherson's book, all
the Irish cried out, We know all these poems, we have always heard them
from our infancy. But when he asked more particular questions, he could
never learn that any one had ever heard, or could repeat the original of
any one paragraph of the pretended translation. This generality, then,
must be carefully guarded against, as being of no authority.</p>

<p>Your connexions among your brethren of the clergy, may here <!-- Page 467 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_467" id="Page_v1_467">[467]</a></span>be of great
use to you. You may easily learn the names of all ministers of that
country, who understand the language of it; you may write to them,
expressing the doubts that have arisen, and desiring them to send for
such of the bards as remain, and make them rehearse their ancient poems.
Let the clergymen, then, have the translation in their hands, and let
them write back to you, and inform you that they heard such a one,
(naming him,) living in such a place, rehearse the original of such a
passage, from such a page to such a page of the English translation,
which appeared exact and faithful. If you give to the public a
sufficient number of such testimonies, you may prevail. But I venture to
foretel to you that nothing less will serve the purpose; nothing less
will so much as command the attention of the public. Becket tells me
that he is to give us a new edition of your Dissertation, accompanied
with some remarks on Temora; here is a favourable opportunity for you to
execute this purpose. You have a just and laudable zeal for the credit
of these poems; they are, if genuine, one of the greatest curiosities,
in all respects, that ever was discovered in the commonwealth of
letters; and the child is, in a manner, become yours by adoption, as
Macpherson has totally abandoned all care of it. These motives call upon
you to exert yourself; and I think it were suitable to your candour, and
most satisfactory also to the reader, to publish all the answers to all
the letters you write, even though some of these letters should make
somewhat against your own opinion in this affair. We shall always be the
more assured that no arguments are strained beyond their proper force,
and no contrary arguments suppressed, where such an entire communication
is made to us. Becket joins me heartily in this application, and he owns
to me, that the believers in the authenticity of the poems diminish
every day among the men of sense and reflection. Nothing less than what
I propose, can throw the balance on the other side. I depart from hence
in about three weeks, and should be glad to hear your resolution before
that time.</p>

<p>This journey to Paris is likely to contribute much to my entertainment,
and will certainly tend much to improve my fortune; so that I have no
reason to repent that I have allowed myself to be dragged from my
retreat. I shall henceforth converse with authors, but shall not
probably for some time have much leisure to peruse them; which is not
perhaps the way of knowing them most to their advantage. I carried only
four books along with me, a Virgil, a Horace, a Tasso, and a Tacitus. I
could have wished also to carry my Homer, but I found him too bulky. I
own that, in common decency, I ought to have left my Horace behind me,
and <!-- Page 468 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_468" id="Page_v1_468">[468]</a></span>that I ought to be ashamed to look him in the face. For I am
sensible that, at my years, no temptation would have seduced him from
his retreat; nor would he ever have been induced to enter so late into
the path of ambition.<a name="FNanchor_468:1_299" id="FNanchor_468:1_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_468:1_299" class="fnanchor">[468:1]</a> But I deny that I enter into the path of
ambition; I only walk into the green fields of amusement; and I affirm,

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hume</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">Edinburgh, 29th September, 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged to you for the information you have
communicated to me, and for the concern you show that justice should be
done to our Highland Poems. From what I saw myself when at London, I
could easily believe that the disposition of men of letters was rather
averse to their reception as genuine; but I trusted that the internal
characters of their authenticity, together with the occasional
testimonies given to them by Highland gentlemen who are every where
scattered, would gradually surmount these prejudices. For my own part,
it is impossible for me to entertain the smallest doubt of their being
real productions, and ancient ones, too, of the Highlands. Neither
Macpherson's parts, though good, nor his industry, were equal to such a
forgery. The whole publication, you know, was in its first rise
accidental. Macpherson was entreated and dragged into it. Some of the
MSS. sent to him passed through my hands. Severals of them he
translated, in a manner, under my eye. He gave me these native and
genuine accounts of them, which bore plain characters of truth. What he
said was often confirmed to me by others. I had testimonies from several
Highlanders concerning their authenticity, in words strong and explicit.
And, setting all this aside, is it a thing which any man of sense can
suppose, that Macpherson would venture to forge such a body of poetry,
and give it to the public as ancient poems and songs, well known at this
day through all the Highlands of Scotland, when he could have been
refuted and exposed by every one of his own countrymen? Is it credible
that he could bring so many thousand people into a conspiracy with him
to keep his secret? or that some would not be found who, attached to
their own ancient songs, would not cry out, "These are not the poems <!-- Page 469 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_469" id="Page_v1_469">[469]</a></span>we
deal in. You have forged characters and sentiments we know nothing
about; you have modernized and dressed us up: we have much better songs
and poems of our own." Who but John Bull could entertain the belief of
an imposture so incredible as this? The utmost I should think any
rational scepticism could suppose is this, that Macpherson might have
sometimes interpolated, or endeavoured to improve, by some corrections
of his own. Of this I am verily persuaded there was very little, if any
at all. Had it prevailed, we would have been able to trace more marks of
inconsistency, and a different hand and style; whereas, these poems are
more remarkable for nothing than an entire, and supported, and uniform
consistency of character and manner through the whole.</p>

<p>However, seeing we have to do with such incredulous people, I think it
were a pity not to do justice to such valuable monuments of genius. I
have already, therefore, entered upon the task you prescribe me, though
I foresee it may give me some trouble. I have writ by last post to Sir
James Macdonald, who is fortunately at this time in the Isle of Skye. I
have also, through the Laird of Macleod, writ to Clanronald, and
likewise to two clergymen in the Isle of Skye, men of letters and
character; one of them, Macpherson minister of Sleat, the author of a
very learned work about to be published concerning the Antiquities of
Scotland. Several others in Argyleshire, the Islands, and other poetical
regions, worthy clergymen, who are well versed in the Gaelic, I intend
also without delay to make application to.</p>

<p>My requisition to them all is for such positive and express testimonies
as you desire; MSS. if they have any, compared before witnesses with the
printed book, and recitations of bards compared in the same manner. I
have given them express directions in what manner to proceed, so as to
avoid that loose generality which, as you observe, can signify nothing.
What use it may be proper to put these testimonies to, I can only judge
after having got all my materials. I apprehend there may be some
difficulty in obtaining the consent of those concerned to publish their
letters, nor might it be proper. But concerning this, I may afterwards
advise with you and my other friends.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you may please acquaint Mr. Becket, that this must
retard for some time the publication of his new edition with my
Dissertation; as the least I can allow for the return of letters from
such distant parts, where the communication by post is irregular and
slow, together with the time necessary for their executing what is
desired, will be three months, perhaps some more; <!-- Page 470 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_470" id="Page_v1_470">[470]</a></span>and, assuredly, any
new evidence we can give the world, must accompany my Dissertation.</p>

<p>I am in some difficulty with Macpherson himself in this affair.
Capricious as he is, I would not willingly hurt or disoblige him; and
yet I apprehend that such an inquiry as this, which is like tracing him
out, and supposing his veracity called in question, will not please him.
I must write him by next post, and endeavour to put the affair in such a
light as to soften him; which you, if you see him, may do likewise, and
show him the necessity of something of this kind being done; and with
more propriety, perhaps, by another than himself.<a name="FNanchor_470:1_301" id="FNanchor_470:1_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_470:1_301" class="fnanchor">[470:1]</a></p>


<h4>(4.)</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">6th October, 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am very glad you have undertaken the task which I used
the freedom to recommend to you. Nothing less than what you propose will
serve the purpose. You need expect no assistance from Macpherson, who
flew into a passion when I told him of the letter I had wrote to you.
But you must not mind so strange and heteroclite a mortal, than whom I
have scarce ever known a man more perverse and unamiable. He will
probably depart for Florida with governor Johnstone, and I would advise
him to travel among the Chickisaws or Cherokees, in order to tame him
and civilize him.</p>

<p>I should be much pleased to hear of the success of your labours. Your
method of directing to me is under cover to the Earl of Hertford,
Northumberland House; any letters that come to me under that direction,
will be sent over to me at Paris.</p>

<p>I beg my compliments to Robertson and Jardine. I am very sorry to hear
of the state of Ferguson's health. John Hume went to the country
yesterday with Lord Bute. I was introduced the other day to that noble
lord, at his desire. I believe him a very good man, a better man than a
politician.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, I have been in company with Mrs. Montague, a
lady of great distinction in this place, and a zealous partisan of
Ossian. I told her of your intention, and even used the freedom to read
your letter to her. She was extremely pleased with your project; and the
rather as the Duc de Nivernois, she said, had talked to her much on that
subject last winter, and <!-- Page 471 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_471" id="Page_v1_471">[471]</a></span>desired, if possible, to get collected some
proofs of the authenticity of these poems, which he proposed to lay
before the Académie des Belles Lettres at Paris. You see, then, that you
are upon a great stage in this inquiry, and that many people have their
eyes upon you. This is a new motive for rendering your proofs as
complete as possible. I cannot conceive any objection, which a man, even
of the gravest character, could have to your publication of his letters,
which will only attest a plain fact known to him. Such scruples, if they
occur, you must endeavour to remove. For on this trial of yours will the
judgment of the public finally depend.</p>

<p>Lord Bath, who was in the company, agreed with me, that such documents
of authenticity are entirely necessary and indispensable.</p>

<p>Please to write to me as soon as you make any advances, that I may have
something to say on the subject to the literati of Paris. I beg my
compliments to all those who bear that character at Edinburgh. I cannot
but look upon all of them as my friends. I am, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_471:1_302" id="FNanchor_471:1_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_471:1_302" class="fnanchor">[471:1]</a></p>


<h3>II.<br />

<small>ESSAY ON THE GENUINENESS OF THE POEMS.</small><a name="FNanchor_471:2_303" id="FNanchor_471:2_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_471:2_303" class="fnanchor" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 70%;">[471:2]</a></h3>

<p>I think the fate of this production the most curious effect of
prejudice, where superstition had no share, that ever was in the world.
A tiresome, insipid performance; which, if it had been presented in its
real form, as the work of a contemporary, an obscure Highlander, no man
could ever have had the patience to have once perused, has, by passing
for the poetry of a royal bard, who flourished fifteen centuries ago,
been universally read, has been pretty generally admired, and has been
translated, in prose and verse, into several languages of Europe. Even
the style of the supposed English translation has been admired, though
harsh and absurd in the highest degree; jumping perpetually from verse
to prose, and from prose to verse; and running, most of it, in the light
cadence and measure of Molly Mog. Such is the Erse epic, which has been
puffed with a zeal and enthusiasm that has drawn a ridicule on my
countrymen.</p>

<p>But, to cut off at once the whole source of its reputation, I shall
<!-- Page 472 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_472" id="Page_v1_472">[472]</a></span>collect a few very obvious arguments against the notion of its great
antiquity, with which so many people have been intoxicated, and which
alone made it worthy of any attention.</p>

<p>(1.) The very manner in which it was presented to the public forms a
strong presumption against its authenticity. The pretended translator
goes on a mission to the Highlands to recover and collect a work, which,
he affirmed, was dispersed, in fragments, among the natives. He returns,
and gives a quarto volume, and then another quarto, with the same
unsupported assurance as if it were a translation of the Orlando
Furioso, or Lousiade, or any poem the best known in Europe. It might
have been expected, at least, that he would have told the public, and
the subscribers to his mission, and the purchasers of his book, <em>This
part I got from such a person, in such a place; that other part, from
such another person. I was enabled to correct my first copy of such a
passage by the recital of such another person; a fourth supplied such a
defect in my first copy</em>. By such a history of his gradual discoveries
he would have given some face of probability to them. Any man of common
sense, who was in earnest, must, in this case, have seen the peculiar
necessity of that precaution, any man that had regard to his own
character, would have anxiously followed that obvious and easy method.
All the friends of the pretended translator exhorted and entreated him
to give them and the public that satisfaction. No! those who could doubt
his veracity were fools, whom it was not worth while to satisfy. The
most incredible of all facts was to be taken on his word, whom nobody
knew; and an experiment was to be made, I suppose in jest, how far the
credulity of the public would give way to assurance and dogmatical
affirmation.</p>

<p>(2.) But, to show the utter incredibility of the fact, let these
following considerations be weighed, or, rather, simply reflected on;
for it seems ridiculous to weigh them. Consider the size of these poems.
What is given us is asserted to be only a part of a much greater
collection; yet even these pieces amount to two quartos. And they were
composed, you say, in the Highlands, about fifteen centuries ago; and
have been faithfully transmitted, ever since, by oral tradition, through
ages totally ignorant of letters, by the rudest, perhaps, of all the
European nations; the most necessitous, the most turbulent, the most
ferocious, and the most unsettled. Did ever any event happen that
approached within a hundred degrees of this mighty wonder, even to the
nations the most fortunate in their climate and situation? Can a ballad
be shown that has passed, uncorrupted, by oral tradition, through <!-- Page 473 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_473" id="Page_v1_473">[473]</a></span>three
generations, among the Greeks, or Italians, or Phœnicians, or
Egyptians, or even among the natives of such countries as Otaheite or
Molacca, who seem exempted by nature from all attention but to
amusement, to poetry, and music?</p>

<p>But the Celtic nations, it is said, had peculiar advantages for
preserving their traditional poetry. The Irish, the Welsh, the Bretons,
are all Celtic nations, much better entitled than the Highlanders, from
their soil, and climate, and situation, to have leisure for these
amusements. They, accordingly, present us not with complete epic and
historical poems, (for they never had the assurance to go that length,)
but with very copious and circumstantial traditions, which are allowed,
by all men of sense, to be scandalous and ridiculous impostures.</p>

<p>(3.) The style and genius of these pretended poems are another
sufficient proof of the imposition. The Lapland and Runic odes, conveyed
to us, besides their small compass, have a savage rudeness, and
sometimes grandeur, suited to those ages. But this Erse poetry has an
insipid correctness, and regularity, and uniformity, which betrays a man
without genius, that has been acquainted with the productions of
civilized nations, and had his imagination so limited to that tract,
that it was impossible for him even to mimic the character which he
pretended to assume.</p>

<p>The manners are still a more striking proof of their want of
authenticity. We see nothing but the affected generosity and gallantry
of chivalry, which are quite unknown, not only to all savage people, but
to every nation not trained in these artificial modes of thinking. In
Homer, for instance, and Virgil, and Ariosto, the heroes are represented
as making a nocturnal incursion into the camp of the enemy. Homer and
Virgil, who certainly were educated in much more civilized ages than
those of Ossian, make no scruple of representing their heroes as
committing undistinguished slaughter on the sleeping foe. But Orlando
walks quietly through the camp of the Saracens, and scorns to kill even
an infidel who cannot defend himself. Gaul and Oscar are knight-errants,
still more romantic: they make a noise in the midst of the enemy's camp,
that they may waken them, and thereby have a right to fight with them
and to kill them. Nay, Fingal carries his ideas of chivalry still
farther; much beyond what was ever dreamt of by Amadis de Gaul or
Lancelot de Lake. When his territory is invaded, he scorns to repel the
enemy with his whole force: he sends only an equal number against them,
under an inferior captain: when these are repulsed, he sends a second
detachment; and it is not till after a double defeat, that he deigns
himself to descend from the hill, <!-- Page 474 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_474" id="Page_v1_474">[474]</a></span>where he had remained, all the while,
an idle spectator, and to attack the enemy. Fingal and Swaran combat
each other all day, with the greatest fury. When darkness suspends the
fight, they feast together with the greatest amity, and then renew the
combat with the return of light. Are these the manners of barbarous
nations, or even of people that have common sense? We may remark, that
all this narrative is supposed to be given us by a contemporary poet.
The facts, therefore, must be supposed entirely, or nearly, conformable
to truth. The gallantry and extreme delicacy towards the women, which is
found in these productions, is, if possible, still more contrary to the
manners of barbarians. Among all rude nations, force and courage are the
predominant virtues; and the inferiority of the females, in these
particulars, renders them an object of contempt, not of deference and
regard.</p>

<p>(4.) But I derive a new argument against the antiquity of these poems,
from the general tenor of the narrative. Where manners are represented
in them, probability, or even possibility, are totally disregarded: but
in all other respects, the events are within the course of nature; no
giants, no monsters, no magic, no incredible feats of strength or
activity. Every transaction is conformable to familiar experience, and
scarcely even deserves the name of wonderful. Did this ever happen in
ancient and barbarous poetry? Why is this characteristic wanting, so
essential to rude and ignorant ages? Ossian, you say, was singing the
exploits of his contemporaries, and therefore could not falsify them in
any great degree. But if this had been a restraint, your pretended
Ossian had never sung the exploits of his contemporaries; he had gone
back a generation or two, which would have been sufficient to throw an
entire obscurity on the events; and he would thereby have attained the
marvellous, which is alone striking to barbarians. I desire it may be
observed, that manners are the only circumstances which a rude people
cannot falsify; because they have no notion of any manners beside their
own: but it is easy for them to let loose their imagination, and violate
the course of nature, in every other particular; and indeed they take no
pleasure in any other kind of narrative. In Ossian, nature is violated,
where alone she ought to have been preserved; is preserved where alone
she ought to have been violated.</p>

<p>(5.) But there is another species of the marvellous, wanting in Ossian,
which is inseparable from all nations, civilized as well as barbarous,
but still more, if possible, from the barbarous, and that is religion;
no religious sentiment in this Erse poetry. All those Celtic heroes are
more complete atheists than ever were bred in the <!-- Page 475 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_475" id="Page_v1_475">[475]</a></span>school of Epicurus.
To account for this singularity, we are told that a few generations
before Ossian, the people quarrelled with their Druidical priests, and
having expelled them, never afterwards adopted any other species of
religion. It is not quite unnatural, I own, for the people to quarrel
with their priests,&mdash;as we did with ours at the Reformation; but we
attached ourselves with fresh zeal to our new preachers and new system;
and this passion increased in proportion to our hatred of the old. But I
suppose the reason of this strange absurdity in our new Erse poetry, is,
that the author, finding by the assumed age of his heroes, that he must
have given them the Druidical religion, and not trusting to his
literature, (which seems indeed to be very slender) for making the
representations consistent with antiquity, thought it safest to give
them no religion at all; a circumstance so wonderfully unnatural, that
it is sufficient alone, if men had eyes, to detect the imposition.</p>

<p>(6.) The state of the arts, as represented in those poems, is totally
incompatible with the age assigned to them. We know, that the houses
even of the Southern Britons, till conquered by the Romans, were nothing
but huts erected in the woods; but a stately stone building is mentioned
by Ossian, of which the walls remain, after it is consumed with fire.
The melancholy circumstance of a fox is described, who looks out at the
windows; an image, if I be not mistaken, borrowed from the Scriptures.
The Caledonians, as well as the Irish, had no shipping but currachs, or
wicker boats covered with hides: yet are they represented as passing, in
great military expeditions, from the Hebrides to Denmark, Norway, and
Sweden; a most glaring absurdity. They live entirely by hunting, yet
muster armies, which make incursions to these countries as well as to
Ireland: though it is certain from the experience of America, that the
whole Highlands would scarce subsist a hundred persons by hunting. They
are totally unacquainted with fishing; though that occupation first
tempts all rude nations to venture on the sea. Ossian alludes to a wind
or water-mill, a machine then unknown to the Greeks and Romans,
according to the opinion of the best antiquaries. His barbarians, though
ignorant of tillage, are well acquainted with the method of working all
kinds of metals. The harp is the musical instrument of Ossian; but the
bagpipe, from time immemorial, has been the instrument of the
Highlanders. If ever the harp had been known among them, it never had
given place to the other barbarous discord.</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>(7.) All the historical facts of this poem are opposed by <!-- Page 476 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_476" id="Page_v1_476">[476]</a></span>traditions,
which, if all these tales be not equally contemptible, seem to merit
much more attention. The Irish Scoti are the undoubted ancestors of the
present Highlanders, who are but a small colony of that ancient people.
But the Irish traditions make Fingal, Ossian, Oscar, all Irishmen, and
place them some centuries distant from the Erse heroes. They represent
them as giants, and monsters, and enchanters, a sure mark of a
considerable antiquity of these traditions. I ask the partisans of Erse
poetry, since the names of these heroes have crept over to Ireland, and
have become quite familiar to the natives of that country, how it
happens, that not a line of this poetry, in which they are all
celebrated, which, it is pretended, alone preserves their memory with
our Highlanders, and which is composed by one of these heroes themselves
in the Irish language, ever found its way thither? The songs and
traditions of the Senachies, the genuine poetry of the Irish, carry in
their rudeness and absurdity the inseparable attendants of barbarism, a
very different aspect from the insipid correctness of Ossian; where the
incidents, if you will pardon the antithesis, are the most unnatural,
merely because they are natural. The same observation extends to the
Welsh, another Celtic nation.</p>

<p>(8.) The fiction of these poems is, if possible, still more palpably
detected, by the great numbers of other traditions, which, the author
pretends, are still fresh in the Highlands, with regard to all the
personages. The poems, composed in the age of Truthil and Cormac,
ancestors of Ossian, are, he says, full of complaints against the
roguery and tyranny of the Druids. He talks as familiarly of the poetry
of that period as Lucian or Longinus would of the Greek poetry of the
Socratic age. I suppose here is a new rich mine of poetry ready to break
out upon us, if the author thinks it can turn to account. For probably
he does not mind the danger of detection, which he has little reason to
apprehend from his experience of the public credulity. But I shall
venture to assert, without any reserve or further inquiry, that there is
no Highlander who is not, in some degree, a man of letters, that ever so
much as heard there was a Druid in the world. The margin of every page
almost of this wonderful production is supported, as he pretends, by
minute oral traditions with regard to the personages. To the poem of
Dar-thula, there is prefixed a long account of the pedigree, marriages,
and adventures of three brothers, Nathos, Althos, and Ardan, heroes that
lived fifteen hundred years ago in Argyleshire, and whose memory, it
seems, is still celebrated there, and in every part of the Highlands.
How ridiculous to advance such a pretension to the learned, who know
that there is no tradition of Alexander <!-- Page 477 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_477" id="Page_v1_477">[477]</a></span>the great all over the East;
that the Turks, who have heard of him from their communication with the
Greeks, believe him to have been the captain of Solomon's guard; that
the Greek and Roman story, the moment it departs from the historical
ages, becomes a heap of fiction and absurdity; that Cyrus himself, the
conqueror of the East, became so much unknown, even in little more than
half a century, that Herodotus himself, born and bred in Asia, within
the limits of the Persian empire, could tell nothing of him, more than
of Croesus, the contemporary of Cyrus, and who reigned in the
neighbourhood of the historian, but the most ridiculous fables; and that
the grandfather of Hengist and Horsa, the first Saxon conquerors, was
conceived to be a divinity. I suppose it is sufficiently evident, that
without the help of books and history, the very name of Julius Cæsar
would at present be totally unknown in Europe. A gentleman, who
travelled into Italy, told me, that in visiting Frescati or Tusculum,
his cicerone showed him the foundation and ruins of Cicero's country
house. He asked the fellow who this Cicero might be, "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Un grandissimo
gigante</span>," said he.</p>

<p>(9.) I ask, since the memory of Fingal and his ancestors and descendants
is still so fresh in the Highlands, how it happens, that none of the
compilers of the Scotch fabulous history ever laid hold of them, and
inserted them in the list of our ancient monarchs, but were obliged to
have recourse to direct fiction and lying to make out their genealogies?
It is to be remarked, that the Highlanders, who are now but an inferior
part of the nation, anciently composed the whole; so that no tradition
of theirs could be unknown to the court, the nobility, and the whole
kingdom. Where, then, have these wonderful traditions skulked during so
many centuries, that they have never come to light till yesterday? And
the very names of our ancient kings are unknown; though it is pretended,
that a very particular narrative of their transactions was still
preserved, and universally diffused among a numerous tribe, who are the
original stem of the nation. Father Innes, the only judicious writer
that ever touched our ancient history, finds in monastic records the
names, and little more than the names, of kings from Fergus, whom we
call Fergus the Second, who lived long after the supposed Fingal: and he
thence begins the true history of the nation. He had too good sense to
give any attention to pretended traditions even of kings, much less
would he have believed that the memory and adventures of every leader of
banditti in every valley of the Highlands, could be circumstantially
preserved by oral tradition through more than fifteen centuries.</p>

<p>(10.) I shall observe, that the character of the author, from all <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_478" id="Page_v1_478">[478]</a></span>his
publications, (for I shall mention nothing else,) gives us the greatest
reason to suspect him of such a ludicrous imposition on the public. For
to be sure it is only ludicrous; or at most a trial of wit, like that of
the sophist, who gave us Phalaris' Epistles, or of him that
counterfeited Cicero's Consolation, or supplied the fragments of
Petronius. These literary amusements have been very common; and unless
supported by too violent asseverations, or persisted in too long, never
drew the opprobrious appellation of impostor on the author.</p>

<p>He writes an ancient history of Britain, which is plainly ludicrous. He
gives us a long circumstantial history of the emigrations of the Belgae,
Cimbri, and Sarmatae, so unsupported by any author of antiquity that
nothing but a particular revelation could warrant it; and yet it is
delivered with such seeming confidence, (for we must not think he was in
earnest,) that the history of the Punic wars is not related with greater
seriousness by Livy. He has even left palpable contradictions in his
narrative, in order to try the faith of his reader. He tells us, for
instance, that the present inhabitants of Germany have no more connexion
with the Germans mentioned by Tacitus, than with the ancient inhabitants
of Peloponnesus: the Saxons and Angles, in particular, were all
Sarmatians, a quite different tribe from the Germans, in manners, laws,
language, and customs. Yet a few pages after, when he pretends to
deliver the origin of the Anglo-Saxon constitution, he professedly
derives the whole account from Tacitus. All this was only an experiment
to see how far the force of affirmation could impose on the credulity of
the public: but it did not succeed; he was here in the open daylight of
Greek and Roman erudition, not in the obscurity of his Erse poetry and
traditions. Finding the style of his Ossian admired by some, he attempts
a translation of Homer in the very same style. He begins and finishes,
in six weeks, a work that was for ever to eclipse the translation of
Pope, whom he does not even deign to mention in his preface; but this
joke was still more unsuccessful: he made a shift, however, to bring the
work to a second edition, where he says, that, notwithstanding all the
envy of his malignant opponents, his name alone will preserve the work
to a more equitable posterity!</p>

<p>In short, let him now take off the mask, and fairly and openly laugh at
the credulity of the public, who could believe that long Erse epics had
been secretly preserved in the Highlands of Scotland, from the age of
Severus till his time.</p>

<p>The imposition is so gross, that he may well ask the world how they
could ever possibly believe him to be in earnest?</p>

<p><!-- Page 479 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_479" id="Page_v1_479">[479]</a></span>But it may reasonably be expected that I should mention the external
positive evidence, which is brought by Dr. Blair to support the
authenticity of these poems. I own, that this evidence, considered in
itself, is very respectable, and sufficient to support any fact, that
both lies within the bounds of credibility, and has not become a matter
of party. But will any man pretend to bring human testimony to prove,
that above twenty thousand verses have been transmitted, by tradition
and memory, during more than fifteen hundred years; that is, above fifty
generations, according to the ordinary course of nature? verses, too,
which have not, in their subject, any thing alluring or inviting to the
people, no miracle, no wonders, no superstitions, no useful instruction;
a people, too, who, during twelve centuries, at least, of that period,
had no writing, no alphabet; and who, even in the other three centuries,
made very little use of that imperfect alphabet for any purpose; a
people who, from the miserable disadvantages of their soil and climate,
were perpetually struggling with the greatest necessities of nature;
who, from the imperfections of government, lived in a continual state of
internal hostility; ever harassed with the incursions of neighbouring
tribes, or meditating revenge and retaliation on their neighbours. Have
such a people leisure to think of any poetry, except, perhaps, a
miserable song or ballad, in praise of their own chieftain, or to the
disparagement of his rivals?</p>

<p>I should be sorry to be suspected of saying any thing against the
manners of the present Highlanders. I really believe that, besides their
signal bravery, there is not any people in Europe, not even excepting
the Swiss, who have more plain honesty and fidelity, are more capable of
gratitude and attachment, than that race of men. Yet it was, no doubt, a
great surprise to them to hear that, over and above their known good
qualities, they were also possessed of an excellence which they never
dreamt of, an elegant taste in poetry, and inherited from the most
remote antiquity the finest compositions of that kind, far surpassing
the popular traditional poems of any other language; no wonder they
crowded to give testimony in favour of their authenticity. Most of them,
no doubt, were sincere in the delusion; the same names that were to be
found in their popular ballads were carefully preserved in the new
publication; some incidents, too, were perhaps transferred from the one
to the other; some sentiments also might be copied; and, on the whole,
they were willing to believe, and still more willing to persuade others,
that the whole was genuine. On such occasions, the greatest cloud of
witnesses makes no manner of evidence. What Jansenist was there in
Paris, which contains several <!-- Page 480 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v1_480" id="Page_v1_480">[480]</a></span>thousands, that would not have given
evidence for the miracles of Abbé Paris? The miracle is greater, but not
the evidence, with regard to the authenticity of Ossian.</p>

<p>The late President Forbes was a great believer in the second sight; and
I make no question but he could, on a month's warning, have overpowered
you with evidence in its favour. But as finite added to finite never
approaches a hair's breadth nearer to infinite; so a fact incredible in
itself, acquires not the smallest accession of probability by the
accumulation of testimony.</p>

<p>The only real wonder in the whole affair is, that a person of so fine a
taste as Dr. Blair, should be so great an admirer of these productions;
and one of so clear and cool a judgment collect evidence of their
authenticity.</p>
